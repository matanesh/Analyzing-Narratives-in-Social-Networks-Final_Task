OCEAN'S EIGHT 

Olivia Milch & Gary Ross 

July 25, 2016 

"
'
EXT. NICHOLS WOMEN"'S PRISON - DAY 

Early spring, sparse moments of green against the sterilegrey of the correctional facility. Straining against thebleakness, small flowers start to bloom. 

The gate clanks open. 

DEBBIE OCEAN, 40"'s, impossibly chic for having just done astint in the slammer -- suit pressed, hair shiny, struts out. 

Her gait suggests an unpleasant if not untenable sojourn.
She greets the world as if it has been waiting for her,
allowing herself a moment of digestion -- her posturerelaxes, she exhales, she closes her eyes. 

She hears before she sees the waiting engine of a classicMercedes, " , ,55, baby Blue. LINUS (Matt Damon) drapes a singlehand on the steering wheel but it"'s a forced nonchalance thatcould never come close to its owner. Danny Ocean Lite. 

LINUS 
Deb... 

Debbie keeps walking. He cruises up next to her. 

LINUS (CONT"'D)
Where"'re you going? 

DEBBIE 

(without looking back)
I have $35 Linus, I can go whereverI want. 

LINUS 
I"'ll give you a ride. 

DEBBIE 
(slows/turns)
He left you his car? 

LINUS 
No. Well -- he knew I loved it... 

DEBBIE 
That"'s not the same thing. 

LINUS 

(seriously/intoned)
He would have wanted me to drive 
it. 

She rolls her eyes. Hot day. Long way to walk. Deb slows. 
So does Linus. He REVS the car in neutral. 

"
'
2. 

DEBBIE 
Don"'t do that, ok. 

LINUS 
Sure. 

She crosses to the passenger"'s side and climbs in. 

INT. CAR - DRIVING - TEN MINUTES LATER 

DEBBIE 
When"'s the funeral? 

LINUS 
Tomorrow at noon. 

DEBBIE 
Where? 

LINUS 
Really nice place...
(off her look)
Queens. 

Linus changes lanes. Starts moving over toward the right... 

DEBBIE 
Where are you going? 

LINUS 
I-95. 

DEBBIE 
Why? 

LINUS 

We thought -- it might be a good

idea to see your folks. 

DEBBIE 
Who thought? 

LINUS 
You know... 

DEBBIE 
Eleven of you? 

LINUS 
Ten. Rusty"'s in England. 

Debbie reaches out and JERKS THE WHEEL crossing two lanes oftraffic. They head toward New York. 

LINUS (CONT"'D)
That is -- dangerous! 

"
'
3. 

DEBBIE 
We"'re going to Manhattan. 

LINUS 
They"'re not gonna like that. 

DEBBIE 
Anything else " , ,they" , , want? 

LINUS 
As a matter of fact... 

He doesn"'t finish. Knows he spilled too much. Deb turns. 

DEBBIE 
What? 

LINUS 
Saul wants to tell you. 

DEBBIE 
Goddammit, Linus. 

LINUS 
He left you a note. 

DEBBIE 
Danny did? 

Nods. 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
Let me see it. 

LINUS 
Well that"'s just it. In the 
confusion with him " , ,passing," , , andclearing out the " , ,effects" , , causewe"'re the ones who have to deal 
with the " , ,effects..." , , 

DEBBIE 
Where"'s the note? 

LINUS 
We"'re not sure. 

DEBBIE 
You lost it? 

LINUS 
It"'ll turn up. 

DEBBIE 
You lost my dead brother"'s note to 
me. 

"
'
4. 

LINUS 
I know what it said. 

Pause. 

LINUS (CONT"'D)
It said he doesn"'t want you to doit. 

DEBBIE 
Do what? 

LINUS 
The job. 

DEBBIE 
You know about that? 

LINUS 
Well not exactly. But the way hewas talking, it sounded prettyclear... 

DEBBIE 
Jesus Christ. 

LINUS 
He was worried about you Deb. He 
doesn"'t want you to go back to -you 
know... 

They have come to a stop on the George Washington Bridge and 
all at once, Deb FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR. She steps out intobumper to bumper traffic heading toward Manhattan, leavingLinus stuck in the car. 

LINUS (CONT"'D)
Deb. Wait. Please!

come to life in a modern context. 

INT. BERGDORF"'S - DAY 

Debbie peruses, approaches the cosmetics counter. Thesalesperson is consumed with a COSTUMER. Debbie subtly grabsa few bottles of face cream and continues looking, developingan air of impatience. Once the salesperson finishes -


DEBBIE 
Excuse me -- I"'d like to return 
these. 

"
'
5. 

SALESPERSON 
Of course. Do you have yourreceipt? 

DEBBIE 

(demonstrating)
No but they"'re unopened, haven"'tbeen touched -


SALESPERSON 
I can"'t accept a return without areceipt -


DEBBIE 
They"'re sealed, brand new -


SALESPERSON 
I understand but we have a strict 
return policy and cannot accept -


DEBBIE 
This is ridiculous. I bought thema week ago. 

SALESPERSON 
Ma"'am -- I need a receipt.

She crosses to the maids cart and grabs a handful ofchocolates. 

INT. BATHROOM - HOTEL ROOM - PLAZA - LATER 

Debbie luxuriates in a bath with all of New York out a hugepicture window beside her. The lights glisten. The planesglide by. She sinks a little lower in the warm water. 
Closes her eyes... 

CUT TO: 

INT. TRENDY CLUB. NIGHT 

CATE late 30"'s, dressed in all black at a landing, hoveringabove her club. It"'s packed with kids and sweat. She 
glances over at the bar. 

A FEMALE BARTENDER 

Is pouring Grey Goose into a tumbler. She catches Cate"'s eyewho shakes her head. The woman, chastised, replaces the GreyGoose and grabs a bottle of well vodka... 

MOVING WITH CATE 

She scans the floor: hormones and sweat. In the far corner 
Lebron James is towering above the throng, dancing. Cate 
descends the stairs and crosses to one of her " , ,Bottle Girls." , , 

CATE 
Did you get him yet? 

BOTTLE GIRL 
No. I will. 

Cate looks at her with judgement: " , ,C"'mon." , , The girl grabsher cell phone hurries across the floor. 

"
'
8. 

CATE wanders toward the back of the club and spots a girlsmoking in the doorway to the alley. She crosses to her and 
the girl immediately drops her cigarette, grinding it out onthe ground. 

CATE 
On a break? 

SMOKER 
Yeah. 

CATE 
How"'s the line? 

SMOKER 
It"'s pretty good. 

CATE 
Is it down the block? 

SMOKER 
(busted)
Not quite. 

CATE 
You know I need a long line right? 

SMOKER 
Sorry. I just got cold. 

CATE 
Here. Take this. 

She removes her scarf, wraps it around the girl"'s neck thensmiles. It"'s a " , ,get-the fuck-out-there smile," , , but still asmile. 

SMOKER 
Thanks. 

ACROSS THE CLUB... 

Lebron is seriously into the music when the Bottle Girl comesup and tries to take a selfie. (The height differential isproblematic.) He squats lower and extends the camera... 

CATE... 

Watching it. 

CATE 
(to her bouncer)
Make sure she pushes that out now. 

BOUNCER 
Hashtag? 

"
'
9. 

CATE 
How bout our address. 

AND SHE IS MOVING AGAIN, this time toward the VIP area wherea YOUNG MAN is holding court with three women and a bottle ofDom. Heavily tatted and well toned. Cate glares -- he looks 
up... 

LUIS 
(beat)
They said I could. 

CATE 
Who? 

LUIS 
The guy at the door. 

CATE 
Instead of buying-off my doormanwhy don"'t you pay your bill fromlast time?

disappearing for a beat...

AND SHE EXITS (TIME CUT) 
Now dressed in a tasteful black suit with sensible shoes. 

CUT TO: 
A CEMETERY 
Gravestones compressed in a long lens and stretching to the

Black SUV"'s roll through the gates. 
INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL 
Everyone is there. BASHER, Linus, SAUL, The MALLOY BROTHERS, 

even YEN. 
THE COFFIN IS WHITE TOO 
With gold handles. A lovely touch of Vegas. 
IN THE PULPIT 
REUBEN (Elliott Gould) is eulogizing: 

REUBEN 
Danny Ocean lived a rich full life.
By any measure, he was a success. 

There is more rustling and a few eye rolls. Reuben 
continues. 

REUBEN (CONT"'D)
Whether in business, not all of 
which we can discuss today... 

A few sighs of relief. 
REUBEN (CONT"'D)
Or as a loving son, to Dennis andDarlene. 

Everyone turns to acknowledge DENNIS OCEAN, seated on the 
left. 
DEBBIE 
Stares straight ahead. Doesn"'t glance at her father. 

REUBEN (CONT"'D)
Or as a brother. 
She looks up. Shakes her head: don"'t you dare. 

"

REUBEN (CONT"'D)

DEBBIE 
Hello, Saul.

You look great. 

DEBBIE 
No I don"'t. 

SAUL 
Well -- you made it. 

DEBBIE 
Yeah. 

SAUL 
Listen to me for a minute... 

DEBBIE 
Don"'t. 

SAUL 
It killed him, Debbie. This life -it 
killed him. 

DEBBIE 
He had a genetic valve disorder. 

SAUL 
Well it didn"'t help. And it"'s no 
good for you either. Please don"'t 
do this. 

DEBBIE 
Do what? 

SAUL 
Whatever it is he wouldn"'t tell us 
you were gonna do. 

Debbie smiles -- doesn"'t respond. She leans over and kissesSaul on the cheek. 

"
'
12. 

EXT. CEMETERY 

Hot day. Birds. She takes off her jacket. Funny how agraveyard can feel like the country. Basher (Don Cheadle)
comes up beside her. 

BASHER 
" , ,ello love. 

DEBBIE 
You too? 

BASHER 
No... Not me. 

She smiles at him. 

BASHER (CONT"'D)
Hear it"'s good though. 

DEBBIE 
He told you? 

BASHER 
Just said it was " , ,somethin"'." , , An"' 
that it was pretty amazing. 

DEBBIE 
He said that? 

BASHER 
Mmm. He said it was insane and 
you"'d end up back in jail but itwas pretty brilliant. 

Sinks in. 

BASHER (CONT"'D)
You coming back to the house? 

DEBBIE 
Nah. 

She motions toward the gang. He nods. 

BASHER 
Sure. 
(beat)
One question. 

DEBBIE 
What"'s that? 

BASHER 
(leans in/a wink)
Why"'d you tell him, love? 

"
'
13. 

CLOSE UP. DEBBIE 

The one question she can"'t answer. It lingers with her. He 
gives her a kiss on the cheek and heads on his way. 
CAR HORN 
Two short beeps. Deb turns... 
HER POV 
The smoked window of a black SUV lowers revealing -CATE 
Blonde, stylish, hair perfectly messy. Her car radio fills 

the graveyard. 
INT. CAR 
Deb climbs in the passengers side as Cate turns down the

music. Cate grabs her friend"'s face. Big kiss on the cheek. 
DEBBIE 
Easy. I"'ve been in the slammer. 
CATE 
Really? Hadn"'t heard. 
DEBBIE 
Thanks. That was stressful... 
CATE 
I"'m sure. 
DEBBIE 
Everybody trying to get me to gostraight. 
CATE 
Kind of cheeky. They"'re crookstoo. 
DEBBIE 
No kidding. 
Cate swings the car onto the expressway. Deb takes off her 
shoes. Puts her bare feet on the dashboard and rubs them... 
Deb puts her bare feet on the dashboard. 
DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
You get the credit line? 
CATE 
Not yet. 

"
'
14. 

DEBBIE 
Why? 

CATE 
Don"'t know what it"'s for. 
(off her look)
Please don"'t do that? 

DEBBIE 
Do what? 

Cate imitates her expression. 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
Oh. That"'s my " , ,just spent four-
years in jail and my partner letsme down face." , , 

CATE 
I"'m not your partner yet.
(cell phone rings)

Hello? 

(beat)
I don"'t care Jeffrey... No I don"'t 
want to talk to her... 

(another beat)
" , ,Cause it"'s not her job anymore.
It was her job until she got fired,
now it"'s not her job...

(listens)
She can write me five letters,
she"'s not getting her job back.

(beat)
Because she stole from me Jeffreyand people who steal are nottrustworthy. 

On that, she happens to lock eyes Deb who starts to laugh.
Cate can"'t help it smiles too. Hangs up. 

CATE (CONT"'D)
I mean " , ,normal" , , people who steal.
Not... 

DEBBIE 
Like professionals? 

CATE 
Yeah. Them. 

INT. ABANDONED THEATER - DAY 

The lights switch on, illuminating a huge empty space. It"'s 
gorgeous in its decay. Carved wood and peeling plaster. The 
gold leaf is sporadic. 

"
'
15. 

DEBBIE 
This is great. 

CATE 
Try heating it. 

She flips on some more lights. 

CATE (CONT"'D)
There"'s a room for you upstairs. 

DEBBIE 
New club? 

CATE 
Maybe one day. 

Deb looks around. More space than she"'s seen in five years. 

DEBBIE 
Did you call Kendall? 

CATE 
She quit. Moved to Hawaii. 

DEBBIE 
(surveying the room)
What about Paige? 

CATE 

(stops)
It would honestly help if I knewwhat all of this was for. 

DEBBIE 
I know... I know... I"'ll tell youtomorrow. 

Deb deposits her bag, crosses to Cate. Gives her a kiss onthe cheek. 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
I"'ll see ya later. 

CATE 
You just got here. 

DEBBIE 
I"'ve been inside for five years.
I"'m going for a walk. 

She turns and heads up the aisle of the theater... 

EXT. ART GALLERY - CHELSEA - NIGHT 

Debbie walks down a familiar cobblestone street. Though sheseems composed, a rage grows within her as she approaches -


"
'
16. 

INT. KLAUS GUNTHER GALLERY - CHELSEA - CONTINUOUS 

Debbie walks into mecca for the downtown art scene. KLAUS 
GUNTHER makes Gagosian jealous. Sycophants, hipsters and alot of money. And in the center of it all stands Klaus 
himself: undeniably handsome, just as oily, he wears a whitelinen shirt unbuttoned to the jewlery. You should see 
through this guy but you can"'t. Debbie grabs a glass ofchampagne from a waiter and crosses toward him. 

KLAUS * 

Is talking with a group of young women, when he spots Debbieand shifts from charm to restrained terror. He makes quickapologies and starts to leave... 

DEB 

Blocks his path. 

KLAUS 
(frozen)
What are you doing here? 

DEBBIE 
Patron of the arts. 

KLAUS 
I have a restraining order. 

DEBBIE 
Good. 

She steps really close to him -- an intimate moment --

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
Do you know what a shiv is? 

He feels something sharp against his ribs. Gasps --

KLAUS 
Stop it -


DEBBIE 
I made this one. Proud of it, too. 
See -- it"'s important not to meltthe toothbrush too much. That wayit keeps its length and the 
strength. So when you stab, youslice up and around. 

Debbie drags the shiv up the front of his shirt, towards hisneck. To a bystander it might look like a flirtatious movewith a large toothpick. 

"
'
17. 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
Nice face. Inside you"'re what welike to call " , ,a pretty girl" , , -


KLAUS 
I"'ll call the police -


Deb takes the shiv and slices up the front of his shirt,
shredding it. She pops the button on his collar, taking itfor a souvenir. 

DEBBIE 
Auf Wiedersehen. 

Debbie strides out, still purposeful, while Klaus looks on,
terrified. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CHINESE TAKE OUT 

All fluorescence and backlit pictures of the dishes. Debbie 
stands at the counter -- draws a long breath of GeneralTso"'s. They hand her a white plastic bag. 

INT. THEATER -LATE 

It"'s dark. A few safety lights are on. Deb enters the back 
of the theater and crosses to a staircase on the side of the 
stage carrying her take out. 

UPSTAIRS LOFT SPACE 

It used to be a rehearsal studio. Vast and open with variousbits of living area defined by loose furniture. It"'s chic in 
a very hard-to-define-kind-of-way. 

DEB 

Crosses to the kitchen area, fishes through drawers for aplate and decamps at the small kitchen table. 

CLOSER 

She takes out the still-warm white containers and dumps themon her plate. Can"'t get to the chopsticks fast enough... 

CATE (O.S.)
Is that all for you? 

DEBBIE 
(turning/mouthful)
Oh, hi. Want some. 

CATE 
No. 

"
'
18. 

Cate"'s wearing a silk chinese robe. She crosses to the 
table. Sits. 

CATE (CONT"'D)
It"'s late. 

DEBBIE 
Took a walk. 

CATE 
Where? 

Deb doesn"'t answer. They look at each other for a beat andexchange five or six lines of unspoken conversation. 

CATE (CONT"'D)
Why would you do something likethat? 

DEBBIE 
I had to. 

CATE 
No, you didn"'t. 

DEBBIE 
Closure? 

CATE 
Bullshit. Did he see you? 

DEBBIE 
Oh yeah. 

Debbie takes the shiv out of her purse and shows it to Cate.
Toothbrush on one end, lethal blade on the other. 

CATE 
Jesus. 
(beat)
Did you " , ,use it?" , , 

DEBBIE 
Just a button. 

She puts Klaus"' button on the table. Cate laughs. Theyshare the moment. Then suddenly... 

CATE 
(calls out)
Hey, Luis... You gotta go. 

Cate doesn"'t turn as the young man from the club enters withpants but no shirt. Even more muscles. Even more ink. 

LUIS 
I can wait. 

"
'
19. 

CATE 
That"'s ok. I"'ll see you soon. 

LUIS 
Seriously. 

CATE 
(turns)
Seriously. Go. 

Luis gets the hints and grabs his shirt, heading downstairs. 

DEBBIE 
Does he have to go? 

Cate laughs. Deb slides over the carton of orange chicken. 

CUT TO: 

EXT. EAST VILLAGE - THE NEXT MORNING 

The place is waking up from the night before. MEN in ORANGE 
SUITS hang off the back of trucks collecting trash. 

CLOSE UP. DEB 

She"'s wide awake. Cate"'s " , ,guest room" , , is a partitioned spacefilled with boxes of bootlegged vodka. A certain larcenous 
charm with a stunning view of the Manhattan Bridge. Deb sits 
up in bed. Stretches (freedom). She stares out the window 
at the building across the alley -- seems to pause... 

FLASHBACK. OCEAN"'S ELEVEN (TRACKING SHOT -- ORIGINALFOOTAGE) 

ZIRGA (CARL REINER) AND TERRY BENEDICT (ANDY GARCIA) walk thecasino floor with their respective henchmen behind them.
They pass.

DEBBIE... 

...who stands at the progressive slots holding a bucket ofsilver dollars (STILL OCEAN"'S ELEVEN -- WE JUST HAVEN"'T SEENTHIS BEFORE.)

INT. HOLDING ROOM 

Bright neon. No frills. Deb sits on a hard plastic chair.

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
I drove here from Bakersfield.

She yells into a pay phone. 

DEBBIE 
" , ,Pulled a lever" , ,? You think that"'s 
what I did? I " , ,pulled a lever?" , ,

21. 

EXTREME WIDE. DOWN ANGLE. CENTRAL PARK - DAY (PRESENT) 

It"'s a massive landscape. People stroll. Boats sail. Kites 
fly. It would take a moment to pick out the two womenheading toward the camera. 

DEBBIE 
Honestly when I tell you, it"'sgoing to sound a little... 

CATE 
Crazy? 

DEBBIE 
Maybe. But there aren"'t any holes.
I"'ve gone through it a milliontimes. 

ANGLE. WOODED PATH 

They stroll toward the camera in the dappled sunlight. Asthey leave the narrow path, Central Park opens in front ofthem. Fifth Avenue looms. Deb stops -- turns toward Cate. 

CATE 
What? 

Deb motions in front of her. 

CATE (CONT"'D)
Trees? 

Deb points to... 

THE MET 

Rising up above the treeline. 

CLOSE UP. CATE 

She cocks her head slightly, takes in the museum. Then she 
reaches for Deb"'s hand and walks her slowly over to a parkbench. They sit together. 

CATE 

(deep breath/softly)
Look -- I have a friend with a 
house on Fire Island. He"'s in 
Europe for a few months and theplace is just sitting empty. You 
could go out there and stare at thewater and just... 

DEBBIE 
This works, Cate. 

"
'
22. 

CATE 
I"'m sure. 

DEBBIE 
It really works. 

CATE 

(pause)
That"'s a museum, Debbie. And theycare about the things inside it.
That"'s what makes it a museum. 

DEBBIE 
We"'re not robbing the museum. 

Pause... 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
We"'re robbing someone in the 
museum. The museum is just thedecoy. 

She looks back at it... 

CUT TO:

INT. MET - MAIN FOYER

CATE 
First Monday in May? 

DEBBIE 
Shh. 

MONTAGE. MET BALL - FILE FOOTAGE 

Years of haute couture on display. The richest models in the

Hundreds of the richest peoplegathered under one roof...

SERIES OF SHOTS. MOS (LONG LENS - FAR AWAY) 

Through the bustle and traffic of New York, Deb explains " , ,thejob"'. In subways... Taxi"'s... Restaurants... With 
diagrams, gestures, and models made of salt shakers and sugarcubes. Slowly, through it all, Cate"'s body language subtlychanges. She begins, literally, to lean in until... 

MET CAFE 

They sit at a table caffeinating in the large open atrium. 

CATE 
Wow. 

DEBBIE 
Wow as in yes? 

CATE 
As in: I get it. It"'s kind of 
brilliant. 

DEBBIE 
I had some time on my hands. 

CATE 
It"'s dangerous... 

DEBBIE 
No doubt. But that"'s not why Ilike it. This works. 

CATE 
(weighs it)
You know I don"'t owe you anything. 

DEBBIE 
Just help me figure it out. Then 
see how you feel. If you don"'tlike it, you don"'t have to do it.
You have an off ramp. 

There is an irritating, irresistible quality that makes herDebbie Ocean. 

CATE 
So what"'s first? 

"

DEBBIE 
We need a designer. 

CUT TO: 

INT. CATE"'S LOFT 

They sit in front of the big screen with the documentaryplaying. They review a large portfolio book of variousdesigners, their work enshrined in plastic. 

CATE 
So I thought about Galliano, but I 
don"'t think Anna"'s gonna let himdress anybody. 

DEBBIE 
Right. 

CATE 
There"'s Largerfeld but it"'s kind ofDr. Strangelove. Not sure it"'s the 
right fit. But here, look atthis... 

She spins the book. Hovers over it... 

DEBBIE 
Rose Weil? 
(beat)
I know that name. 

CATE 
Huge in the 90"'s. New Romantic 
stuff. Edwardian collars. But... 

(flips a page)
Hasn"'t gone so well lately. She 
owes the IRS 5 million dollars. 

DEBBIE 
Woah. 

CATE 
It"'s bad. A lien on her assets. 
Impounded her passport. The bank 
seized her townhouse. 

DEBBIE 
She sounds perfect.

After a minute ROSE WEIL, 40"'s, flustered, lurches toward atrash can, vomiting pre-show. 

CATE (V.O.)
The show was meant to save her. 

INT. FASHION SHOW - BRYANT PARK - EVENING 

Amazonian women appear in outfits that suggest a laboredattempt at a Victorian theme -- high buttons, lace bodices. 

CATE (V.O.)
If the new line doesn"'t take off,
she could even be prosecuted. 

There is a distracting murmur -- this is not going well.
Amongst the unimpressed celebrities, a worried group ofmiddle-aged, Mid-Western Men sit in the front row. 

CATE (V.O.)
Got a credit line from an Omaha 
Bank. The only ones who wouldstill loan her money... 

They literally are soaked in sweat -- stare perplexed at therunway at... 

CATE 
Tough way to get into fashion. 

THE LAST MODEL 

Strides out in a corset with over abundance metal buckles -
BDSM meets Pirates of the Caribbean. 

She turns to the top of the runway to introduce Rose, but no 
one appears. Finally, one of the models drags her on-stageto take a bow before a half-empty tent. 

INT. BACKSTAGE - FASHION SHOW - LATER 

The silent break-down of a failed show: Naked models down 
champagne, designer detritus covers the floor -- no onescurries to pick it up. 

Cate wanders through the room, searching for Rose. She 
pauses at the sound of SOBS coming from the other side of acloset door. Cate opens it to find a weeping Rose, sittingon the floor, eating Nutella. 

CATE 
(beat)
It was gorgeous. 

ROSE WEIL 
(looks up/tear stained)
It was shite. 

"
'
26. 

CATE 
I think that"'s a little harsh. 

ROSE WEIL 
" , ,Derivative of myself." , , That"'s 
what they say. Do you know what ahell that is? Resenting who youwere because you"'ll never be that 
again -


(shovels Nutella)
How did I get here? 

CATE 

(sinks to the floor/gently)
You spent 18 million dollars in two 
years. You had two house boats on 
the Seine. 

Cate takes her hand. 

ROSE WEIL 
(softly)
I know. And they were divine.
(a beat)
I"'m old. 

CATE 
You"'re not old -


ROSE WEIL 
I"'m old and -(
heaves)
I"'m going to go to prison -- and(heaves)
And then I"'m going to be poor... 

CATE 
Not necessarily. 

Rose looks up. Hmm? 

CATE (CONT"'D)
What if I could make all of this go 
away. Even get your passport back. 

Long pause --

ROSE WEIL 
What do I have to do? 

CATE 
Dress Daphne Kluger for the Met 
Ball. 

Rose stares up her.

ROSE WEIL 
Are you real?

Very.

CHAIRWOMAN 
The Met Ball is all about grace andelegance and refinement -- soeveryone can understand why wechose Ms. Kluger to host it. 

The crowd erupts in laughter, heads thrown back and shouldersrising like a ballet of bobble-heads. Except for Cate andDebbie, seated in the back row, straight-faced. A REPORTER

DAPHNE KLUGER

DEBBIE

She tosses an embossed photo on the table. Rose leans in.

flips her hole card and shows an 8 to total 17.

Fine. I wont do it. I"'ll call it 
off. 

CATE 
Oh good. Glad we had this talk. I 
feel all better now. 

DEBBIE 
I mean it. 

(then...)
You"'ve never been in there. You 
don"'t know what it"'s like. 

CATE 
And I don"'t want to find out. 

DEBBIE 
You won"'t. I promise. 

Deb extends her hand. Leaves it out there for an eternity. 

CATE

Who"'s that?

She motions toward a Crown Victoria parked at the curb. A

Deb sits across from Klaus Gunther: bleached smile and 
slicked back hair. 

DEBBIE 
So what do I have to do? 

CUT TO: 

KLAUS"' BED 

He and Debbie (post coital) lie in his sheets. 

KLAUS 
It"'s not really a forgery becausewe"'re not copying any knownpainting. It"'s previouslyundiscovered work. 

DEBBIE 
Gotcha. 

KLAUS 
I can"'t sign the provenance becausethey know me but... 

DEBBIE 
It"'s still fraud. 

KLAUS 
That"'s not clear.

INT. SMALL BAR - LOWER EAST SIDE 

Cate"'s first club. There isn"'t much room. 

CATE 
It"'s still fraud. 

DEBBIE 
That"'s not clear. 

CATE 
I know Klaus Gunther. I"'ve known 
him for ten years. 

DEBBIE 
Oh, yeah. He wants you do it too.
He can"'t front as the owner because 
they know him. 

CATE 
I"'m sure they do. 

DEBBIE 

The sale goes through his gallery,
Cate. He"'s on the line too. One 
signature. Half a million dollars 

CATE 
Yeah. That"'ll show your brother. 

DEBBIE 
No. 

(pointed)
That"'ll mean we can stop hittingshitty casinos on the gulf coast. 

CATE 
I"'m out. 

DEBBIE 
Fine. 

CATE 
Don"'t trust him, Deb. 

DEBBIE

Who said I trust him. 

INT. CIPRIANI - THIS TIME LUNCH... 

Deb sits alone waiting for Klaus. Checks her watch. She"'s

DEBBIE 
Ok, remember -- this is a run-

mistakes. Nobody panics, this iswhy we do this. If somethinghappens and you don"'t expect it,
it"'s no big deal. We roll with it,
regroup later.

Any questions? 

CUT TO: 

INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - LATER THAT NIGHT 

Constance, as she puts on her Audio Guide, moves through latehours at the Met. A little looser and boozier than the 
normal crowd. Young professionals mill about. 

NINE BALL (V.O.)
Okay, here we go --

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MARK HOTEL - NIGHT 

The Mark is the The Hotel of Choice for all Gala attendees --
our Headquarters for the night --The new, temporary WarRoom. A monitor shows a mini version of the Security Hubmonitors. Nine ball has hacked into the system. 

NINE BALL 
Places, ladies... 

INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - SAME 

Constance puts her foot up on a bench to tie her shoe, nextto where An ELDERLY MUSEUM-GOER sits. Constance takes off 
her headset, places it on the bench next to her so she canpull back her hair. 

The Elderly Museum-Goer rises, gathers her things anddeparts. Constance does so a few moments after.

NINE BALL 
(headset)
Constance, go -- get moving -


Constance doesn"'t move. 

NINE BALL (CONT"'D)
(louder)
I said, " , ,Go!" , , 

AN ELDERLY WOMAN... 

Hears Nine Ball YELLING at her in the Met Audio Guide. She 
taps her headphones. 

CONSTANCE 

Looks equally perplexed: 

CONSTANCE 
Who"'s Winslow Homer? 

The Elderly Museum-Goer is next to her -- hearing Nine Ball"'s 
shouts growing more obscene. 

ELDERLY MUSEUM-GOER 
Is it supposed to be interactive?
Why is this painting yelling at me? 

Constance looks at the bewildered museum-goer, realizes theheadsets have been switched. She takes the REAL one from the 
Elderly Woman"'s hand. Back on track. 

CONSTANCE 
Okay, okay, I"'m here. 

NINE BALL 

(on the headset)
Back to one. Like you"'re comingout of the bathroom. 

She hurries over to the door of the women"'s bathroom. 

NINE BALL (CONT"'D)
Move. 

Constance emerges and passes Debbie just outside thebathroom. She hands her a string of Mardi Gras beads as astand-in for the necklace. 

DEBBIE 

Takes off the other direction moving through the gallery... 

NINE BALL (V.O.)
Legit.

INT. AMERICAN WING - METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM OF ART 

Debbie keeps moving past George Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton,
Eakins, then slows... 

DEBBIE 
Saul? 

She stops. Turns. Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) is admiring apainting by William Merrit Chase. She moves closer. He 
turns as if surprised. 

SAUL 
Oh! My goodness. I can"'t believe 
it! Hello -- you look gorgeous. 

DEBBIE 
What are you doing here? 

SAUL 
You know. Art. I love this guy.
Big fan. 

He motions toward the painting. Deb stands in front of the 
label describing the painting. 

DEBBIE 
Who"'s it by? 

SAUL 
Aw, c"'mon. Don"'t do that. I care 
about you. Is that a sin? 

DEBBIE 
When you meddle. Yes. 

SAUL 
I"'m a 90 year old Jew. Meddling isall that"'s left. 

She starts to leave. 

SAUL (CONT"'D)
Wait! 

He shuffles to keep up with her. Takes her arm... 

SAUL (CONT"'D)
Can we sit down? 

Saul is a little out of breath. They sit on the paddedbenches in front of the paintings. Saul"'s wipes some sweatwith a handkerchief. 

SAUL (CONT"'D)
This isn"'t going to work. 

"
'
73. 

DEBBIE 
You don"'t know that. 

He winces -- an expression of Jewish doubt. Sucks air 
through his teeth. 

DEBBIE (CONT"'D)
Why are you still listening to mybrother, Saul? He"'s dead. 

SAUL 
He loved you. He didn"'t want youto go to jail. 

DEBBIE 
He had no idea who I was. 

SAUL 
Oy. 

(kids)
You can"'t argue with a dead person 
sweetie. My Sadie? I argued withher for years. I"'d even go out tothe cemetery. You know how crazythat looks -- an old man yelling attombstone? 

(pats her hand)
Leave it. 

DEBBIE 
I have. 

SAUL 
(looks around the museum)
No, you haven"'t. 

DEBBIE 
This has nothing to do with him. 

SAUL 
Ok. Come out to the house 
sometime. We can play cards. 

DEBBIE 
No way. I"'ve played cards with you. 

SAUL 
Then we can have some smoked fish. 

DEBBIE 
Deal. 

She leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Saul smiles. He 
pats her hand.

If you want to fight with somebody,

DEBBIE

SAUL

Yeah.

You might be ok after all. 

He pushes himself up and heads off into the museum.

Deb crosses to the car and is just about to confront them

when she looks up to see... 
Cate, rounding the corner from the other direction. Theypause at the car, smile at each other. Deb taps on thewindow and they roll it down slowly. 
DEBBIE

Hey guys. This is my friend Cate.
We"'re gonna be in for most of thenight so if you want to run out andgrab a bite or something it"'s fine. 
Cate smiles. Nods.

An armored car (BRINKS) waits with the engine running. TWO 

GUARDS carry a large-strong box with the HARRINGTON necklacein it. 

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - THE MARK HOTEL - EVENING 
Daphne walks in dressed in heels and lingerie, hair incurlers, drinking whiskey. She sits in a Director"'s chair as 
a team of make-up people go to town. A MANICURIST takes her 
hand, another works on her feet -


INT. THEATER 
Six women (Rose is missing), are dressed to the nines infront of a wall mirror. Finishing touches are applied: hairtweaks, mascara, re-applied lipstick...

EXT. MARK HOTEL - SAME 

The BRINKS truck arrives in the front of the hotel. 

INT. LOBBY - MARK HOTEL 

Rose stands at the elevator doors looking up at the floorindicator. As it descends toward her she grows more and morenauseous, stifling a gag as the doors opens... 

INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - THE MARK HOTEL -MINUTES LATER 

Daphne, now in a robe, is getting her hair sprayed, her eyeshadow 
blended. She glances in the mirror in front of her tosee Rose and two men in suits behind her. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Is that it? 

Rose nods and stands to the side. The two guards fromTiffany"'s move into the room, carrying a large velvet jewelbox. There is a weird ceremony to all of this: the placegoes quiet; the men march forward in an even cadence. Rose 
crosses behind Daphne as the Harrington is revealed... 

DAPHNE 
Holy shit. 

ON ROSE 

She reaches forward and opens the top of Daphne"'s robe,
revealing the nape of her neck. Rose puts the Harringtonaround her neck and fastens the clasp: it sounds like 
tumblers clicking. 

ROSE WEIL 
Might be a little cold. 

DAPHNE 
And heavy. 

The mirror glitters --it"'s almost celestial. 

ROSE WEIL 

(deep breath)
Ok. Let"'s get this off and get youdressed. 

She reaches up and starts to fiddle with the clasp whichdoesn"'t seem to open. 

TITUS (TIFFANY GUARD)
Oh --can"'t get it off like that. 

He steps forward pulling out a small pen like cylinder. 

"

78. 

TITUS (CONT"'D)

Special clasp. Needs this magnet. 
Titus crosses behind her and fits the device over the clasp.
He gives it a half turn and the necklace unlocks. 

CLOSE UP. ROSE 
She is somewhere between ashen and light green. Rose takes 
quick shallow gasps clutching the arm of the chair. 
ROSE WEIL 
Oh that"'s... Brill--iant. 
(forced smile)
Let me see that again. 

Titus, full of pride fastens the clasp, then shows the smallmagnetic cylinder like a magician demonstrating a trick. 
DAPHNE 
Takes in all of this from the mirror. The necklace. Titus 

behind her... and behind him Rose who steadies herself with 
one hand, clutching her iPhone in the other. 
DAPHNE"'S POV. ROSE"'S IPHONE (TIGHT) 
She points it at the back of Daphne"'s neck.

Stan Smiths and a vintage flower dress. She runs up to Deband her sister.

Haute Couture Mayhem -- as the cameras and crowds go wild.

Exiting her limo, looking pretty damn amazing in her owngown, but no one takes much notice of her. It"'s a prettydress. No twelve foot train, but way better than an orangejump suit.

Chanel, Dior, Givenchy... 
DAPHNE AND KLAUS... 
Stroll through the exhibit. 
MOVING WITH DEBBIE 
She watches them. 
DAPHNE AND KLAUS 
Utterly unfazed, they pause in front of: 
A matte black infinity. The room looks like it extends for a 

football field. The black sky is punctuated by FLOATINGJEWELS -- each their own supernova: Diamonds, sapphires,
rubies, emeralds, they gleam as if emitting their own light. 

They float in space, suspended from the ceiling, eachdescribing an invisible human form. It"'s like Yayoi Kusama"'sInfinity room but way cooler and A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. A 
million dots of light into infinity -- a celestial wonder. 

INT. HALAL CART 
Cate watches THE MONITOR, where Klaus Gunther leans over and

whispers something to Daphne who throws her head back in apeel of laughter. 
Cate doesn't react. She turns and leaves. 
INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR (DINING ROOM) 
On the stage at the front of the hall, a jazz quartet plays.

The room fills with slightly lubricated guests. Everyonemigrates toward their seats, appraises dresses they"'ve yet tosee, people with whom they haven"'t schmoozed --

TAMMY OBSERVES... 

DAPHNE AND KLAUS: a suprisingly-great-first-date energybetween them. They move to their table --
ROSE... 
Already sits, enjoying her second glass of wine. Daphne and

Klaus take their place next to her. (Top designers arealways seated next to the " , ,designed." , ,)

Debbie hasn"'t taken her eyes off of Daphne and Klaus. He 

leans in and whispers to Daphne, half nibbling her ear.
Whatever. 

INT. HALAL CART

Huh? 
The Soup lands in front of Daphne. 
DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT"'D)

Oh, thank God. 
She grabs her spoon and instead of bringing cutlery to mouthshe reverses the process, nearly plunging into the steamingbowl. Daphne is four spoons deep before she ever breathes. 

DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT"'D)

Oh, my --

DAPHNE KLUGER

As Daphne removes her hand, a torrent of vomit flows into thetoilet -- the noise is loud and painful, as if her stomach isbeing excavated. 

After several wretches, Constance soothes her, strokesDaphne"'s hair. The side of her cheek. The back of her 
neck... 

CONSTANCE 
There, there --
Another wretch.

Nine Ball leans into the monitor. 

NINE BALL 
They"'re stalled in the hallway.
Chatting. 

TAMMY... 
Hears it and takes off toward the kitchen. She catches up tothe busboy carrying a tray of dirty dishes and a hundredmillion dollar necklace. 
TAMMY 
What the hell are you doing! 
BUSBOY 
Sorry. 

"

TAMMY 

You"'re not getting paid to talk.

Get in there. 

FOLLOWING THE BUS BOY 

As he heads up the hallway into... 

THE KITCHEN 

Steam. Shouting. Rattling plates. But where Cate was 

standing, now, there is... 
NO ONE 
Cate is gone. The busboy enters looking for a dish washing

station. 
NINE BALL (V.O.)
(over the headset)
Anybody got eyes on Cate? 
AMITA (O.S.)

Here! I"'ll take those. 

REVERSE ANGLE 

Amita is scouring the cutlery dressed as a dishwasher. The 

bus boy dumps his tray into her sink and heads back toward

the party. 

CLOSER. AMITA 
She reaches into the soapy water and fishes around throughthe slime. All at once she stops; knows that feeling. Amita 
fishes 150 million dollars out of the goop. 

HER POV 

It"'s covered with gunk but still glistens. Amita grabs the

overhead nozzle and rinses off the Harrington necklace untilit gleams. 
WIDER 
She sticks it into her pocket and calls out to the rest of 

the kitchen. 
AMITA 

Bathroom break! 

MOVING WITH HER 

Amita crosses to the bathroom and locks the door behind her.

INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM (SINGLE STALL) 

Single toilet. Sink. Tampon dispenser. Changing table. 

Amita draws a long breath and takes out the Harrington. Wow. 
Then she opens the tampon dispenser, displaying a full arrayof jewlers tools, neatly organized and fastened. 

AMITA 
Dope. 

She grabs the loupe and slips it on her head, then turns andopens the changing table: a work bench. 

INT. HALAL CART 

Nine ball is scanning the various images. 

NINE BALL 

(into headset)
Where"'s Cate. Anybody? Need eyeson Cate. 

AT THE PARTY: 

ENTRANCE TO THE LADIES ROOM 

Debbie is still loitering outside the door. Feels like 
forever. She glances at Titus then back at her watch... 

DEBBIE 
(to Nine Ball/in headset)
Forget her. Stay focused. 

TAMMY (O.S.)
You"'re avoiding me. 

Debbie turns to see... 

TAMMY standing next to her. 

DEBBIE 
(beat)
What? 

TAMMY 

(presses close)
Seriously. We were going to talkwhen I started, and then there wasso much to get ready for, and thenwhen I wanted to have a biggerconversation you said everyone wasaround and we needed time if we 
wanted to have a " , ,real" , , talk. So I 
thought great she wants to have a" , ,real" , , talk, but... 

"
'
92. 

DEBBIE 
Can we just do this later? 

TAMMY 
That"'s all you ever say. 

DEBBIE 

(whispers)
Like a hundred million dollars 
later? 

TAMMY 
There"'s never a good time. 

DEBBIE 
Honestly Tam, there are bettertimes than this. 

TAMMY 
Ok. 

And she walks away shaken but proud of herself for havingsuch an important, if difficult, conversation. 

ANGLE. BATHROOM DOOR 

Daphne comes out, pale green --very pale. Wipes hermouth... 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
That was gnarly. 

TITUS 

Looks relieved -- then not... 

HIS POV. CLOSE UP. DAPHNE KLUGER"'S DECOLLETAGE 

The Harrington Necklace is missing. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
(feeling their stares)
What? 

One of them (gently) grabs her. The other pushes past herinto the bathroom --

CUT TO: 

INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM 

She has removed the first diamond from the Harrington andholds it up to her loupe. Slight gasp. 

"

93. 

EDGE OF THE DINING ROOM... 

Debbie watches the panic build. Daphne is surrounded by asecurity team who escort her back to the table. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I"'m not sure. It could have fallen 
off back here. Or maybe inthere... I don"'t know, I justbarfed an organ out... 

The phalanx moves toward the table. Walkie-talkies crackle. 
More security descend on the room. 

ROSE WEIL 
Are you alright? Oh, you poordear. 

KLAUS 
What"'s going on? What happened? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
It must have fallen off, or -


KLAUS 
(seeing the missingnecklace)
Are you joking with me? 

JUDAS 
(approaching)
Nothing in the bathroom --

DAPHNE 
Jesus. 

ROSE WEIL 
Maybe a spot of tea... 

JUDAS 
They"'re sealing the exits. 

INT. HALAL CART 

NINE BALL 
Exits being sealed now. Amita? 

AMITA (V.O.)

Excellent. Sweeping the room. 

INT. MAIN HALL 

The entire party is being guided into the foyer by securityguards. 

INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR 

Most of the guests have been cleared out leaving the placeweirdly empty -- a restaurant at closing time. Daphne andKlaus are talking to security while people search the place. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
(to the crowd)
I am just so sorry... 
(a distinction)
For real. 

INT. EXHIBIT 

It"'s completely empty. Silent. Glistening. Now it does 
look like outer space... 

INT. MAIN HALL 

A GALA ORGANIZER speaks into a wireless microphone. 

GALA ORGANIZER 

(too close -- feedback)
Um -- we apologize for thisinterruption but -- someone hasmisplaced a rather expensive itemand they tell us we"'re going tohave to stay here while theysearch. I"'ve told them this needs 
to happen quickly so I"'m sure itwill. I"'m confident that we will 
all be back to dessert shortly. 

INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR 

As the security teams furiously searches, Tammy is perched on 
the far side of the room -


CLOSER 

She whispers into her headset -


TAMMY 
They"'re at table three, seven andten. Still a crowd around table 
one. Give it a second.

NINE BALL 
Rodger that. Super chill. 

ANGLE. TABLE ONE 
It has been combed over. Several of the security team glanceat each other. Nothing. They move on to table two... 

INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM 
Amita works furiously. She"'s already fashioned four sets ofearrings, three rings, two necklaces. She works on a 
bracelet. A POUND at the door -AMITA 
(calling out)
I"'m oc-u-pied... 
She stares down at the completed bracelet in her hand. 

CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN 
Security guards use handheld metal detectors to comb through

the waitstaff --

Once you"'ve been checked, please

head toward the far exit --
The kitchen staff begins to clear out. Still no Cate. 
INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR 
CONSTANCE comes blowing through the entrance and slams into -TAMMY 
Who is heading in the other direction. 
CLOSE UP. SLOW MOTION... 
Constance"'s left hand deftly slips the PASTE (THE ONE FROM

THE 3D PRINTER) into Tammy"'s hand --

CUT TO: 
INT. HALAL CART 
Nine Ball speaks into her headset. 

NINE BALL 
All going down. Police coming,

INT. TEMPLE OF DENDUR 

Daphne sits at her table, stunned. 

TITUS 
Ms. Kluger -- was there anythingyou did or anyone you talked tobetween your table and thebathroom? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I was barfing. 

TITUS 
I understand that. Do you rememberstill having the necklace when youwere seated at... 

TAMMY 
Oh my god!
(loud, eager)
FOUND IT! 

They turn. 

TAMMY... 

Pulls the necklace from a crease in the table cloth holdingup the necklace (PASTE) like a trophy. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Thank fucking God. 

TAMMY 
It was under the tablecloth -- in a 
crease. In the table. You know 
where they fold...

(re: security)
Maybe you just didn"'t see it thefirst time or something... 

TITUS 
(into his earpiece)
We got it back. 

CUT TO: 

INT. EMPLOYEE BATHROOM 

Amita cleans up her workstation -- she wears a new pair ofBRILLIANT earrings. A knock on the door. Amita opens it. 

CONSTANCE 

Slides in the bathroom.

CONSTANCE 
(sees the jewels)
Wo. Sick. 
Constance starts pocketing the rest of the new jewelery. 
AMITA 

Be careful. There"'s glue. 
Constance nods (sure whatever). Slips out of the room whichis now just... A bathroom. 

EXT. HALAL CART 

Nine Ball emerges from her falafel stand wearing couture.
She heads across the street toward the Met. 
INT. MAIN ENTRANCE HALL - METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM OF ART 
Daphne now stands on the stairs above the main hall, while

Klaus (gallantly) places the necklace around her neck. 
KLAUS 
If I may... 
Cameras flash, seizing upon the intimate moment. 
ANNA WINTOUR 
Thank you, Ms. Kluger, for theexcitement. 
(a beat, to the crowd)
Let"'s finish the party, shall we. 

Everyone files back in -- calm, bonded by the trauma, joyful,
a little less formal and more fun -LONG 
LENS. CONSTANCE 
As she moves through the party... 
Past Tammy... 
Past Rose pounding down a last glass of champagne... 
Past Nine Ball who is now a radiant partygoer.... 
Finally face to face with DEBBIE... 
CLOSER 
Constance pretends to trip, grabs onto Debbie momentarily -


CONSTANCE 
Oh, sorry. " , ,Scuse me. 
Constance catches her balance and moves on.

Looks down at a gorgeous diamond necklace in her hand.

Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga perform " , ,Diamonds Are a Girl's

EXT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART 
Constance exits the Museum, back in her ball gown -- hot

pink, strapless, and satin --now adorned with a beautiful 

diamond pendant and matching earrings --
Amita, too, has changed into a ball gown -- Deep purpleoffset by diamonds and emeralds that dangle from her ears -


Nine Ball emerges in an impeccable satin tuxedo with a 

massive ring and matching necklace. 
Tammy descends. Forest green a-line dress --a strand of 
diamonds looped twice around her neck. 

Rose swaggers out, a little loose and loving it --a new 

diamond choker gracing her neck. 
Debbie floats down the steps -- wearing her new necklace -- a 
chain choker in the front and a long drop chain cascadingdown her backless dress. 

No Cate. 

Debbie checks her watch. Glances around. Is just about tocheck it again when she looks up... 
DEBBIE"'S POV: CATE 
Transformed, descending the stairs in a bright yellow ball

gown wearing long dangling diamond earrings. She locks eyeswith Debbie. Slight nod.

Neon signs in the window, " , ,ATM," , , " , ,COFFEE," , , " , ,OPEN." , , The bells 
on the door ring -- Amita enters, sits at the counter. She 
looks at the menu. Constance enters -


CONSTANCE 

Just one -She 
takes a seat a couple stools down from Amita. Nine Ball 
arrives, nods to the other women, sits. Tammy enters, stillscrolling on her phone. Rose comes, still wasted. 

"

She tries to play the claw-game -- but she hasn"'t put in any 
money. She finds her way to the counter -


ROSE WEIL 
Oh, helloooo. 

Debbie and Cate enter together, taking the two middle seats.
They all wear the jewels as they look up and smile. 

EXT. DINER - WIDE 

It looks Edward Hopper"'s Nighthawks but instead of normal 
patrons there are eight women wearing over 200 milliondollars in jewelry. 

DISSOLVE TO: 

INT. TIFFANY"'S VAULT - DAY 

The two large Security Guards carry the box down the halltoward the waiting associate. 

ANGLE ON - THE ASSOCIATE"'S FACE 

As he lifts the lid. He wears a loupe. He takes the 
necklace up in his hand, inspects in under the light --

And nearly PASSES OUT --

CUT TO: 

EXT. TIFFANY'S HEADQUARTERS - LATER 

An old-school yellow cab screeches up. 

JOHN FRAZIER, late 40"'s, Men"'s Warehouse suit from his yearlytrip to the Hackensack outlet, salt-of-the-earth, exits. Heinhales, looks around, heads in. 

INT. TIFFANY"'S CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 

The Tiffany"'s Associate sits at the table, shaking, givinginto the fact that even in his worst nightmares he could notconjure up the circumstance which he is now experiencing. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
So you"'re certain the necklace inyour possession is a paste? 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
(shudders)
Yes. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
And when did you last see what youbelieve to be the authentic item? 

"
'
100. 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
Last night, in Ms. Kluger"'s suite. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Now Larry -- may I call you Larry? 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
Lawrence --

JOHN FRAZIER 

My experience is, sooner or later

people want to be rewarded for

their patience.

(takes out a toothpick,

picks with vigilance)

A necklace that"'s been sitting in a

vault for 30 years isn"'t doing

anyone any good. Nobody"'s seen it,

no one even knows what it is. But 

you place that necklace on a very

well-known young lady, on an

evening where said placement gets

lots of play and attention and all

of sudden everyone and their mother

knows about that necklace. That 

necklace becomes very famous, very

quickly -- right? 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
Yes... 

JOHN FRAZIER 

And then if that necklace goes

missing? 

John grabs every daily paper from his bag, throws them on thetable -- all the headlines are about the NECKLACE. 

JOHN FRAZIER (CONT"'D)

Well what else would people talk

about? That"'s a tale of scandal 

and intrigue that gets people

talking and buying. 

(almost whispers)

And what they don"'t know is it is

insured for $270 million -- so now 

you"'re up a quarter billion

dollars, your name"'s in everyone"'s

mouth, and you"'re missing a little

necklace that no one had ever seen 

anyway. You get the publicity and 

the money. 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
Are you accusing us -


"
'
101. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Merely floating a theory --

(smiles)
That"'s my job. See if it were me,
I"'d do it early in the night. Get 
it off our hands quick. 

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
What are you suggesting? 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Speculating. That it wasn"'t the 
real necklace to begin with. Thatsomeone swapped it out before iteven went on Ms. Kluger"'s neck --

TIFFANY"'S ASSOCIATE 
I guarantee the necklace on Ms.
Kluger"'s neck when she left thathotel was the real one --

John Frazier shrugs. 

PRELAP: 

JOHN FRAZIER 
So tell me again how you rememberit. 

TIME CUT TO: 

INT. TIFFANY"'S CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 

John stands in front of four massive cloth covered boards --
he has transformed the Conference Room into Ground Zero for 
his investigation. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
They put the necklace on me, I didmy silly walk, we saw the exhibit,
I ate my soup, hurled my guts out --
The necklace was gone, everyonefreaked out and then they found thenecklace again. 

Frazier takes the clothes off the boards behind him -- they 
reveal Daphne"'s entire night reconstructed with images fromGetty, Buzzfeed, Instagram, Paparazzi and Security footage.
In most of the images, Klaus is standing right next to her. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Thank you, Ms. Kluger.
Fortunately, I"'ve been able totrace every step of your night asrelying on your memory would be --
well -- less dependable consideringyour level of refreshment.

JOHN FRAZIER (CONT'D)
So as you can see in all of thesephotos, there is a young manstanding next to you --Mr. Klaus 
Von Gunther? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
He was my date -


JOHN FRAZIER 
(amazed)
Is that his real name? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I have no idea. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
German? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Austrian. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Six o"' one. Was there ever a time 
when you two were alone while youwere wearing the necklace? 

Daphne locks eyes with him --

Passionately making out against a wall in a dark corner of a 
Gallery --

CUT TO: 

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIFANY"'S - RESUME 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
No. 

John looks over the images of Klaus and Daphne -- he istouching her neck a lot, as if coveting the necklace. John 
sits on the edge of the table -


JOHN FRAZIER 
Do you suspect he would have anymotivations to take the necklace? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I try not to guess about people"'smotivations. They tend to show 
you. 

"
'
103. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
That"'s a sufficiently vague answer.
(beat -- looks at the

board)
You know, I have every minuteaccounted for except five -


He looks down at a sheet of paper on the table --

JOHN FRAZIER (CONT"'D)
Well, four minutes, 48 seconds tobe exact. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I was probably rubbing one out. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
They said you were charming.

(beat)
Funnily enough, the unaccounted forminutes do line up with when youwere disposed by your sickness. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
When I was throwing up? 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Was there anyone in the bathroomwith you at the time? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
My head was at the bottom of atoilet bowl. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
How bout after --

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Lots of people. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
I mean in the bathroom. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Don"'t you have cameras in there? 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Sadly no. Legal thing. Whoever 
took this necklace is pretty smartand probably a woman. Or someone 
dressed as such. Or maybe thisGerman fellow but that"'s a bit of a 
reach. 

He lays out photos of Daphne with Rose, Tammy, and Debbie in 
the background -- they are zoomed in or from the edges ofphotos of her -- the cobbling together took a long time. 

"
'
104. 

JOHN FRAZIER (CONT"'D)
Do you know any of these women? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
That"'s Rose Weil, she designed mygown, which you obviously know,
that chick was some type of eventplanner, I think, and her -- I"'venever seen before in my life. 

INT. CATE"'S THEATER - DAY 

The team dismantles their headquarters. The replica of themain exhibit still stands in the background. Everyoneglances up at the sound of heels clicking against the wood of 
the stage... 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
You guys are fucked. 

She enters from stage right and wanders over to a largeinvestigation board --

DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT"'D)
Wow. It"'s like everyone watchedHomeland and got ideas --

Photos of Klaus and Daphne throughout the night -- he seemsenamoured with the necklace. 

DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT"'D)
(re: the board)
Can I keep this? 

TAMMY 
You"'re trespassing. 

CATE 
We asked her to come. 

Daphne grabs an apple from the table and plops (crash-lands)
on the couch. All eyes turn to Debbie and Cate. 

DEBBIE 

(deep breath)
I realized about a week ago thatMs. Kluger... 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Wasn"'t a total fucking idiot. 

DEBBIE 
Might have gotten a sense of whatwe were doing.

Shh. 

RESUME. WAREHOUSE 

The rest of the women pay rapt attention. 

DEBBIE 
So we figured the only way thismight work was to take her into ourconfidence. 

Daphne takes a huge bite of her granny smith. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
(mouthful)
I even threw up for real. 

TAMMY 
You were in the whole time? 

CATE 
Recently. 

DAPHANE KLUGER 
(preens)
One take, baby. 

DEBBIE 
And it seemed to us -- that eightshares of a hundred and thirtymillion are better than seven 
shares of nothing. Right?

Insurance fraud? 

DEBBIE 
I was getting to that. 

AMITA 
When? 

DEBBIE 
It seems that RGI has assigned aninvestigator who... 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Is about to look up your ass with aflashlight. 

ROSE WEIL 
(panicked)
Who"'s this? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
Little Colombo dude. Totally onto 
you. Everything but the trench-
coat. Do you guys have anything todrink? 

ROSE WEIL 
Alright... Lest we forget.
This... This entire... 
" , ,enterprise" , , was to keep me out of 
jail. 

DEBBIE 
Nobody"'s going to jail. We 
expected this. We"'re veryprepared. 

NINE BALL 
Looks like it. 

DEBBIE 
WE are not going to be the primesuspects.

TAMMY 
I"'d go to jail with you, Deb. 

DEBBIE 
Well that"'s very nice but...

Who are the prime suspects? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
That German creep who sent her 
away.

(beat)
Don"'t you watch any movies -- likeDouble Indemnity? These insurance 
guys are smart. You gotta framesomebody else. 

Cate and Deb exchange a look. Moment of truth. Beat... 

CATE 
Of course you do. 

Deb nods. Daphne kicks off her shoes, putting her bare feeton the coffee table. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
I know I look like Daphne Kluger,
but I only play her in real life.

Stunning -- it may be the mostflawless diamond I have ever seen. 
This was your mother"'s? 

RENE

The Appraiser smiles -- examines it -- thinks... 

SOTHEBY EXEC 
Well, next week"'s auction is our

DIANA (OLDER THAN THE OTHERS) 

Sits in the same chair, staring intently at a diamond ring 
which gives Elizabeth Taylor"'s a run for its money. She 
studies it, trying to summon a recollection. She gives up --

wanna steal a necklace?" , , 

KLAUS 
You were in my house? 

JOHN FRAZIER 
The door was open. 

KLAUS 
Do you have a warrant? 

JOHN FRAZIER 

(laughs)
Gosh no. I work for an insurance 
company. 

KLAUS 
Then I think we"'re done here. 

Pause. Tense silence. 

KLAUS (CONT"'D)

Really. 

John Frazier nods. Didn"'t even finish his Coke. 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Could you call me a taxi?

EXT. HUDSON RIVER PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 
Klaus sitting on a bench. He"'s looking down toward the endof the island. Boats glide by. He fights the sun. 

FROM FAR AWAY... DAPHNE"'S SILHOUETTE... 
Approaches from down-river. She wears a black trench coat 
cinched at the waist and high heels considering the walk. Itwould make anyone sit up and take notice... 

CUT TO: 
EXT. 7TH AVE - NIGHT 
Neon. Car horns. Buses. 
DEBBIE 
Presses her way out of the subway -- fighting through the

throng. 
MOVING WITH HER 
Through street vendors and tourists. Every nut imaginable.

She turns into the blinding light of... 
INT. CARNIGIE DELI 
The DING of the door -- she glances around. The HOSTESS

That"'s what you said in Philly. 

DEBBIE 
I know. But I didn"'t. 

JOHN FRAZIER

Pickle? 

She takes one. Crunchy... 

DEBBIE 
Let"'s say I knew where part of thenecklace was -- hot goods --
totally traceable... Could you geta search warrant? 

JOHN FRAZIER 
Don"'t know. Depends who"'s got it.

Of course.

KLAUS 
(struggles to talk)
What kind of game? 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
(sex game)
You know. Like a " , ,card" , , game.

Half a bottle of vodka thunders into the toilet. Klaus

You have no idea how this came to 
be in your possession. 

KLAUS 
None. 

DETECTIVE 
But you were Ms. Kluger"'s date thenight these necklaces wereswitched.

INT. CATE"'S WAREHOUSE 

The Crew celebrating -- everyone is drinking.
Congratulations all around. Then -


DAPHNE KLUGER (O.S.)
I got a question? 

WIDER 

Everyone turns to look at Daphne who is sitting on a crateperplexed. She looks down at her iPhone where she"'s been 
working the calculator. 

DAPHNE KLUGER 
So you sold "'bout 35 million worthof jewelry right? 

"

Pause. She lowers the phone. 

DAPHNE KLUGER (CONT"'D)

All eyes on Debbie. They wait to see what she"'s going to do.
Ok -- why not? 

DEBBIE 
What? -- You thought we were justgoing to steal ONE necklace? 

INT. EXHIBIT - METROPOLITIAN MUSEUM OF ART - (FLASHBACK) 

Daphne and Klaus stare at the main hall of the exhibit -


DEBBIE 

On the other side, staring longingly at them.

See, while everyone was worryingabout what was around your neck...

Pulling it down the hall -- now wearing a janitors uniform. 

DEBBIE 
And everybody was watching theentrance... 

INT. MET - JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN 
The catering cart comes to a stop--

AMITA (V.O.)
Felt like I worked at Kinkos. 

BACK AT THE HEIST. (OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN) 

Yen hops up on the catering cart and gives Cate a hand. She 
climbs on it as well, putting Yen on her shoulders. Debbie 
holds the cart as Yen pops open a vent climbing into theceiling.

INT. AIR DUCTS 

Yen, Debbie and Cate crawl through the vent. 

DEBBIE (V.O.)
Now, when we modified the exhibit,
we also changed the background fromreflective black to matte black. No 
big deal, except it was the exact 
same material our good friend Yenwas wearing. 

"
'
120. 

We see Yen -- hooded from head to two black lower himself 
into the exhibit. 

DEBBIE 
So even though he was visible to usfrom the vent... 

FROM THEIR POV 

The cloaked figure of Yen hangs in space -


DEBBIE 
He was invisible to the securitycameras against the blackbackground... 

NINE BALL 

Watches from her bank of monitors. She sees nothing on her 
screen. 

RESUME. LOFT 

They all sit mesmerized... 

DEBBIE 
But since it would have been bad to 
see the jewels move, Nine Ball here 
helped us customized the cameras. 

NINE BALL 
I just changed the specs a littleonline. 

ANGLE. YEN 

He takes an iPhone, snaps a picture of the exhibit and slidesit into a special housing on the front of the security 
camera. 

NINE BALL 

Sees a momentary blur then the exhibit looking perfectlynormal -


DEBBIE 
Now all of the jewels are weighted.
But when you know the piece, andthe exact karats, it"'s easy tocalculate that weight. 

AMITA 
It"'s just a little math.
