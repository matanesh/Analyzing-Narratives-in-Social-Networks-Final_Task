1
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,886
Hello.

2
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,930
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:50,808
Daddy.

4
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,143
It's early.

5
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:53,811
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,439
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:59,150
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,359
No,

9
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,236
but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:05,531
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:05,615 --> 00:03:09,452
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:13,122
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:13,164 --> 00:03:14,832
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:14,915 --> 00:03:17,335
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:19,879
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:25,301
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:27,637
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,764
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:32,642
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:34,352
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,561
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,229
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:40,066
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:43,569
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,321
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:48,824
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:48,866 --> 00:03:49,992
I love you.

28
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,661
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:03:51,744 --> 00:03:53,162
D... Dad?

30
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,460
I love you, too.

31
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,593
I sent it.

32
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:09,220
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:10,513
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:11,764
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:13,099
So?

36
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:14,517
How do you feel?

37
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,102
I'm fine.

38
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:17,395
Fine?

39
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,397
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,065
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:22,316
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,401
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

43
00:04:23,484 --> 00:04:24,986
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

44
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,196
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:30,074
What about them?

46
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:32,410
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:33,411
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,454
Well... after you.

49
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:44,672
For after the haul.

50
00:04:45,715 --> 00:04:47,466
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,135
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:50,344
No.

53
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,345
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,805
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,849
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,559
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:59,228
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,856
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,441
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:05:03,524 --> 00:05:04,609
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,652
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:08,613
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:09,905
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:11,866
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,659
When?

66
00:05:15,828 --> 00:05:18,581
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:20,082
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,417
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,418
Come on.

70
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:23,836
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:34,513 --> 00:05:35,431
Come on.

72
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:36,641
Let's go.

73
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:38,100
What is it this time?

74
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:39,560
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:40,811
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:42,104
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:43,314
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:47,109
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,780
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:52,114
Can we go? Please?

81
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:54,617
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,118
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:57,411
Untie that line.

84
00:05:57,453 --> 00:05:58,579
Today.

85
00:05:58,663 --> 00:05:59,747
Yeah.

86
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:00,790
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:01,916
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,289
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:41,372 --> 00:06:43,624
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:45,084
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,711
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:48,337
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,380
We're in Italy.

94
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,673
Speak English.

95
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:52,466
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:06:52,508 --> 00:06:57,096
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

97
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:01,475
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:03,728
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:03,811 --> 00:07:05,521
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,940
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:10,067
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:11,193
They'll be there.

103
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,653
You can trust these guys.

104
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:15,072
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:07:15,197 --> 00:07:19,577
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,751
We're in.

107
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:28,187
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:37,905
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:37,947 --> 00:08:39,448
They will be.

110
00:08:39,532 --> 00:08:41,534
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:45,413
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:52,336
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,587
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,259
Charlie?

115
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,053
Keep going?

116
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,055
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,057
It's a go.

118
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:09,812
Okay, Steve.

119
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:15,818
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

120
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,069
Got it.

121
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:18,821
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:09:18,904 --> 00:09:20,448
from the north wall.

123
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:22,241
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:24,619
Got it.

125
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:25,745
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:00,112
Now, paint.

127
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:03,491
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,660
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,954
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,666
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:38,943
Yeah.

132
00:10:41,195 --> 00:10:42,113
Bene.

133
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:45,908
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:50,408
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:53,160
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,829
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,163
Let's go.

138
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:18,829
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:54,782
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,063
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,486
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,488
To us.

143
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:40,531
Yay!

144
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:46,495
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,999
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,959
without even holding a gun

147
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,628
because he planned this
down to a "T."

148
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:55,963
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:57,048
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:58,841
- Charlie!
- Yay!

151
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,635
Thank you.

152
00:18:00,718 --> 00:18:01,969
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,763
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:18:03,846 --> 00:18:05,056
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:06,474
Come on, you guys.

156
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,726
Take a lesson from an old man.

157
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:10,519
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,314
In what?

159
00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:15,274
In gold.

160
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:18,611
Let's figure out

161
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,821
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,949
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,325
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

164
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:25,493
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:27,286
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,496
in leather seats.

167
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,081
Obviously. See?

168
00:18:30,164 --> 00:18:32,333
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,668
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,753
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:18:35,836 --> 00:18:37,505
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:18:37,588 --> 00:18:40,383
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

173
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,343
Yeah.

174
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,511
It's a big stereo.

175
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,763
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

176
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,014
Now you're talking.

177
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,102
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

178
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:53,354
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

179
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:54,897
right there.

180
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,524
Get me a big house...

181
00:18:56,565 --> 00:18:58,192
get me a library
full of first editions.

182
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,568
Get a room for my shoes.

183
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:01,612
What about you, Steve?

184
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:04,031
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

185
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:05,908
You haven't decided yet?

186
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:07,868
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

187
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,869
I liked what you said.

188
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:10,413
I'll take one of each of yours.

189
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:13,708
Well, well, two of everything

190
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,209
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

191
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:16,294
Oy!

192
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,384
Loved the toast.

193
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:25,636
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

194
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,055
No, you were incredible.

195
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:29,557
Just incredible.

196
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,058
You saw the whole picture.

197
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,393
You covered all the angles.

198
00:19:33,436 --> 00:19:35,229
You know, Charlie,

199
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:38,399
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

200
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:41,068
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

201
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:45,072
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

202
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:47,074
Don't be the latter.

203
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:49,243
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

204
00:19:49,285 --> 00:19:51,078
in this life.

205
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,581
What are you talking about,
John?

206
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,082
You've been a good father.

207
00:19:55,124 --> 00:19:58,753
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

208
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,339
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

209
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:05,343
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

210
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:09,388
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

211
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,557
and hold onto her forever.

212
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,644
- Okay?
- Hey.

213
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,771
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

214
00:20:16,812 --> 00:20:19,106
Yeah.

215
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,108
Steve's getting cold.

216
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,610
You, too?

217
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:23,778
I'm all right.

218
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:26,447
I love you, kid.

219
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:27,907
You did really great.

220
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,451
Thanks, John.

221
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:33,913
Let's go.

222
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:45,299
Money

223
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:47,927
It's a gas

224
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:55,142
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

225
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,688
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

226
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:00,564
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

227
00:21:00,648 --> 00:21:02,275
He was like Don Johnson.

228
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,360
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

229
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:06,529
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

230
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:15,579
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

231
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:17,164
What's this, what's this?

232
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,169
Who the hell are these guys?

233
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:26,632
Hey!

234
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:27,800
Take your hands off the wheel.

235
00:21:27,883 --> 00:21:28,509
Steve!

236
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,848
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

237
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,062
No, no, no, no,

238
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:41,355
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

239
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,356
what the hell are you doing?

240
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:43,774
Made a few plans of my own.

241
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:49,447
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

242
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,448
You know that.

243
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:51,741
I think that's probably right,
John.

244
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:53,367
Go! Go!

245
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,766
Charlie.

246
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,811
We got to go, Charlie.

247
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,272
You always work in the dark?

248
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,024
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

249
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:15,319
Not bad.

250
00:25:15,403 --> 00:25:17,071
Not bad, Stella.

251
00:25:17,196 --> 00:25:18,906
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

252
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,241
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

253
00:25:20,283 --> 00:25:21,242
who to call first.

254
00:25:21,284 --> 00:25:22,285
You're expensive, Stella.

255
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,079
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

256
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,914
Good will, community service.

257
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:29,083
I do it for the money, Paul.

258
00:25:29,125 --> 00:25:30,626
I'll be sending you a bill.

259
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,503
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

260
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:33,587
I never look inside.

261
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,257
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

262
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,383
Hi, Stella.

263
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:40,344
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

264
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:43,598
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

265
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,308
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

266
00:25:45,391 --> 00:25:48,102
Time, time for this girl
to sing

267
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,896
Damn if I thought
that you would change

268
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,107
And my life would stay
the same

269
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:55,610
Things will come
and things will go

270
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:57,987
And one thing I know
for sure

271
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:02,033
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

272
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:03,701
I'm walking out the door

273
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,996
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

274
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,831
Oh, it's time...

275
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:13,294
How long to crack it?

276
00:26:13,336 --> 00:26:15,755
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

277
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:16,756
Oh! You're the man.

278
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:17,798
What's on the lineup?

279
00:26:17,882 --> 00:26:19,008
Todd Milliken called.

280
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,593
He has a prototype
combination lock.

281
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:22,011
He wants you to test out.

282
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:23,220
He says he added

283
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:26,265
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

284
00:26:26,349 --> 00:26:28,100
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

285
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,310
give him a thrill.

286
00:26:29,352 --> 00:26:31,604
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

287
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:34,899
Says you two know each other.

288
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,696
Charlie Croker.

289
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,323
Hey, Stella.

290
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:47,286
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

291
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,957
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

292
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,458
right in front of your eyes,

293
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,377
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

294
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,800
We found him, Stella.

295
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:03,636
He's in Los Angeles.

296
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:04,762
The gold bricks he stole from us

297
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:06,180
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

298
00:27:06,222 --> 00:27:07,473
I just got word,

299
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,891
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

300
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,310
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

301
00:27:11,394 --> 00:27:13,020
Yeah?

302
00:27:13,062 --> 00:27:14,438
Well, how do you know it's him?

303
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:18,234
Skinny Pete sent me this.

304
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:20,486
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

305
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,452
Why you telling me
all of this?

306
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:30,705
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

307
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:32,331
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

308
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:33,874
delivered to his home office.

309
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,376
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

310
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:37,044
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

311
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:38,087
No, you don't.

312
00:27:38,212 --> 00:27:39,088
The problem now is no one

313
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:40,423
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

314
00:27:40,506 --> 00:27:42,591
And I need somebody
I can trust.

315
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:44,260
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

316
00:27:44,343 --> 00:27:45,595
I'm not a thief.

317
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:47,555
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

318
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:48,848
John was like a father
to me, too.

319
00:27:54,562 --> 00:27:55,813
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

320
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:57,815
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

321
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,448
I've moved on.

322
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:11,264
Come on, Charlie.

323
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:13,349
Come on.

324
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:20,564
Hello?

325
00:29:20,648 --> 00:29:22,483
I want to see the look
on that man's face

326
00:29:22,566 --> 00:29:23,901
when his gold is gone.

327
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:27,154
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

328
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:32,618
She's in.

329
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,328
That's a good thing?

330
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,454
It's a very good thing.

331
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:37,373
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

332
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,958
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

333
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,084
a good idea, Charlie.

334
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:41,085
She's got the skill

335
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,295
and she's got the motivation.

336
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:43,796
Exactly.

337
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:45,089
She's emotional.

338
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:47,383
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

339
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:49,010
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

340
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,511
We're all emotional on this one.

341
00:29:50,553 --> 00:29:52,805
Let's go.

342
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:54,390
Are you ready?

343
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:55,558
Of course I am.

344
00:29:58,185 --> 00:29:59,729
You're not ready.

345
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,505
That was quick.

346
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:27,632
Where are they?

347
00:30:27,715 --> 00:30:28,883
We're a little early.

348
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:31,552
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

349
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:33,804
There.

350
00:30:33,888 --> 00:30:34,931
That's Lyle.

351
00:30:35,014 --> 00:30:36,641
He's my computer genius.

352
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:44,106
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

353
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,566
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

354
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,778
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

355
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:50,696
and stole his idea.

356
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,586
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

357
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,298
Hey.

358
00:31:11,258 --> 00:31:12,385
Oh...

359
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,054
You okay?

360
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:17,890
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

361
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:20,059
That's Left Ear.

362
00:31:20,685 --> 00:31:22,103
Demolition and explosives.

363
00:31:22,186 --> 00:31:23,104
When he was ten,

364
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:25,106
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

365
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:27,775
Fire...

366
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:29,568
Whoa.

367
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:30,736
Yeah, that was cool.

368
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,988
How'd you do that?

369
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:33,114
What?!

370
00:31:33,155 --> 00:31:34,448
How'd you do that?

371
00:31:34,532 --> 00:31:35,533
What?!

372
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:37,952
I said,
how did you do that?

373
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:40,413
What?!

374
00:31:40,496 --> 00:31:42,123
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

375
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:44,375
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

376
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:49,005
Handsome Rob.

377
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,131
Premier wheel man.

378
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:51,632
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

379
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:53,592
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

380
00:32:02,476 --> 00:32:04,645
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

381
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:06,105
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

382
00:32:06,188 --> 00:32:07,773
from women
who saw him on the news?

383
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:09,984
You're a heartbreaker

384
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,569
Dream-maker

385
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:12,570
Love-taker

386
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:14,655
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

387
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:20,828
And you?

388
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:23,414
I never heard
how you got your start.

389
00:32:23,497 --> 00:32:25,625
Me?

390
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,377
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

391
00:32:28,461 --> 00:32:31,505
Okay, you both know what to do.

392
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,007
Cough it up, now!

393
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:36,927
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

394
00:32:37,011 --> 00:32:38,930
One, two, three, baby...

395
00:32:39,805 --> 00:32:40,973
Watch it, spaz!

396
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:42,725
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

397
00:32:42,808 --> 00:32:43,768
Hey, what's your problem, man?

398
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,312
A-B-C, it's easy

399
00:32:46,395 --> 00:32:48,147
As one, two, three...

400
00:32:49,231 --> 00:32:50,149
Hey, Charlie.

401
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:51,359
Good to see you, man.

402
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,610
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

403
00:32:52,693 --> 00:32:55,071
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

404
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:56,072
Hello, Charlie.

405
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:57,740
Rob, what's up?
Good?

406
00:32:57,823 --> 00:32:59,325
Guys...

407
00:32:59,408 --> 00:33:00,493
Stella Bridger.

408
00:33:00,576 --> 00:33:02,787
Hi.

409
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,788
How you doing?

410
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:04,997
Nice to meet you.

411
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:06,082
Phones?

412
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:07,375
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

413
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:08,876
I got internal chips in them.

414
00:33:08,918 --> 00:33:10,044
Please change them twice a day.

415
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:11,837
We will get heat on line.

416
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:13,089
I.D. s?

417
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:16,968
"James Hymen?"

418
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:19,262
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

419
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,514
140 pounds? Try 165.

420
00:33:21,597 --> 00:33:22,848
Try lifting some weights.

421
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,350
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

422
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,851
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

423
00:33:25,935 --> 00:33:26,852
Let's go.

424
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,020
Hey, Charlie...

425
00:33:29,313 --> 00:33:31,107
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

426
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,402
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

427
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,989
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

428
00:33:38,072 --> 00:33:42,660
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

429
00:33:42,743 --> 00:33:45,579
No, no

430
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:48,124
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

431
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,583
And you can't go wrong

432
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:54,380
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

433
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:56,924
California soul

434
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:59,677
Ooh-ooh-ooh

435
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,723
California soul...

436
00:34:03,806 --> 00:34:06,475
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

437
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,227
this joker picked Hollywood.

438
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:10,563
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

439
00:34:10,646 --> 00:34:12,106
All right...

440
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:13,941
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

441
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,776
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

442
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:17,945
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

443
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:19,530
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

444
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:21,032
I crack into the phone company's

445
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:22,867
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

446
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,951
there's a legal tap on the line.

447
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:24,994
Just reroute the digital copies

448
00:34:25,077 --> 00:34:26,537
of the calls to our own
listening post.

449
00:34:26,621 --> 00:34:27,955
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

450
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,498
How long?

451
00:34:29,582 --> 00:34:31,208
No... how long will it take?

452
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:32,793
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

453
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:34,629
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

454
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:38,799
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:34:38,883 --> 00:34:40,676
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

456
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,428
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

457
00:34:42,511 --> 00:34:44,972
Five minutes flat.

458
00:34:45,014 --> 00:34:46,515
Don't be cocky, young lady.

459
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:48,684
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

460
00:34:50,061 --> 00:34:51,687
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

461
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:53,230
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

462
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,357
whole different ball game.

463
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,902
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

464
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:00,780
Look, just remember,

465
00:35:00,863 --> 00:35:01,906
this is all the easy part, okay?

466
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,240
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

467
00:35:03,324 --> 00:35:04,450
So what's the sketch?

468
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:05,534
We drive to Union Station.

469
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:08,412
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

470
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:10,081
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

471
00:35:10,206 --> 00:35:12,208
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

472
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,407
Oh, great.

473
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,825
Carson Security System.

474
00:35:45,908 --> 00:35:47,743
How good is it?

475
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:49,495
Carson's held
an annual contest...

476
00:35:49,578 --> 00:35:52,123
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

477
00:35:52,248 --> 00:35:54,709
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

478
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,920
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

479
00:35:58,004 --> 00:36:00,589
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

480
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:01,966
It's an anti-scaling fence.

481
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:04,010
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

482
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:06,053
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

483
00:36:06,137 --> 00:36:07,221
with some nitromin.

484
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,556
Security on the property?

485
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,016
Got an armed guard here.

486
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:11,058
Little rent-a-cop,

487
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:12,560
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

488
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,061
But that booth...

489
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:17,064
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

490
00:36:17,106 --> 00:36:18,482
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

491
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:20,693
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

492
00:36:20,776 --> 00:36:22,570
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

493
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:26,073
Shit.

494
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:28,909
This dude got dogs.

495
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:30,745
I don't do dogs.

496
00:36:30,828 --> 00:36:33,331
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

497
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:34,665
What happened?

498
00:36:34,749 --> 00:36:37,918
I had a bad experience.

499
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:39,754
Damn it. I'm deaf.

500
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:56,103
You turn in your badge

501
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,272
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

502
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:00,650
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

503
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:02,652
Crush.

504
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:03,736
I don't want to see you

505
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:05,988
anywhere near
this investigation.

506
00:37:06,072 --> 00:37:08,908
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

507
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:09,909
I don't want to see you

508
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:11,535
anywhere near
this investigation.

509
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,915
Hey! It's a green!

510
00:37:15,998 --> 00:37:18,584
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

511
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,461
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

512
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:21,253
anywhere near this...

513
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,839
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

514
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:29,387
Unbelievable.

515
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:43,025
There he is.

516
00:38:01,794 --> 00:38:04,422
Let's get to work.

517
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:10,886
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

518
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,388
slit-your-wrist traffic.

519
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:14,682
You know, five people died
from smoking

520
00:38:14,765 --> 00:38:16,058
in between traffic lights today.

521
00:38:16,142 --> 00:38:18,060
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

522
00:38:18,144 --> 00:38:19,437
You could always use that.

523
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,646
That'd be ideal

524
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,648
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

525
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:24,859
What's your guesstimate?

526
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,403
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

527
00:38:27,486 --> 00:38:30,573
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

528
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,575
but if we had green
lights all the way,

529
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:34,243
we could do it in 14 minutes.

530
00:38:34,327 --> 00:38:36,495
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

531
00:38:39,874 --> 00:38:40,750
Whoa.

532
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:45,588
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

533
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,548
Lyle?

534
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,425
Lyle?

535
00:38:50,843 --> 00:38:52,345
I'll see what I can do.

536
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:58,643
You're right on time.

537
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,733
All these poor bastards
out there,

538
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:07,568
putting their life
savings in banks,

539
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,570
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

540
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:11,906
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

541
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,741
they can depend
on the government?

542
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,076
I don't think so.

543
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,494
Are you taping me?

544
00:39:16,577 --> 00:39:18,245
Of course not.

545
00:39:18,287 --> 00:39:19,956
I never tape you...
come look,

546
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,123
see for yourself.

547
00:39:23,626 --> 00:39:26,754
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

548
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:30,299
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

549
00:39:31,384 --> 00:39:32,468
Like my cousin Mashkov

550
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:35,638
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

551
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:38,724
gold."

552
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:47,942
Every time I look
at these engravings...

553
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:50,778
She's so beautiful.

554
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,947
Where'd you say you got these?

555
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:54,115
I didn't.

556
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,039
A little walking around money.

557
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,260
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

558
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:15,303
I'm... sorry.

559
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,846
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

560
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,806
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

561
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,141
I'm just middleman.

562
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:22,476
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

563
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:24,020
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

564
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:36,157
So, what does a man

565
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:39,160
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

566
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,457
He watches his big-ass TV.

567
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:49,003
That's our in.

568
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:12,652
Stella.

569
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:14,612
Jesus!

570
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:16,447
Charlie!

571
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:17,949
How did you get in here?

572
00:41:18,032 --> 00:41:19,492
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

573
00:41:19,575 --> 00:41:21,994
What... so you just
let yourself in?

574
00:41:22,078 --> 00:41:23,287
I was just making sure
you were okay.

575
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:24,664
I apologize. I just...

576
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:27,541
- I...
- Don't look.

577
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:33,214
Okay.

578
00:41:36,217 --> 00:41:37,593
You got a lot of stuff here.

579
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:40,554
You know,
your dad was old school.

580
00:41:40,638 --> 00:41:42,556
Did the whole thing by touch.

581
00:41:42,598 --> 00:41:44,642
That worked for him;
this works for me.

582
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:47,687
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

583
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,231
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

584
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:53,818
Why the headphones?

585
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,653
Just training myself.

586
00:41:55,736 --> 00:41:58,364
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

587
00:42:01,325 --> 00:42:03,035
What do you want, Charlie?

588
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:05,913
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

589
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:07,665
and we need to send in
a repairman.

590
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:10,084
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

591
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:11,585
Yep.

592
00:42:11,669 --> 00:42:14,380
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

593
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:17,842
Except me.

594
00:42:21,512 --> 00:42:22,680
I'll do it, Charlie.

595
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:26,183
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

596
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:28,728
All right.

597
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:30,271
I'll set it up.

598
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:31,439
Okay.

599
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:33,024
Um... you, um...

600
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:34,692
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

601
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:35,776
before I go back to my room?

602
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:41,782
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

603
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,909
Just get it all done tonight.

604
00:42:43,993 --> 00:42:45,620
Yeah.

605
00:42:45,703 --> 00:42:46,871
Sorry I scared you.

606
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:48,956
It's okay.

607
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:48,998
|

608
00:42:48,998 --> 00:42:50,583
Good night.

609
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:53,461
Bye.

610
00:42:53,544 --> 00:42:56,130
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:57,798
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:42:57,882 --> 00:43:00,092
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:43:00,217 --> 00:43:01,093
You know what he said?

614
00:43:01,218 --> 00:43:02,553
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:43:02,637 --> 00:43:03,846
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,932
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:08,100
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:10,102
when he stole it from me!

619
00:43:10,227 --> 00:43:12,772
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:15,775
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:16,776
They shut him down.

622
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:19,820
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:21,989
Here... here we go.

624
00:43:22,073 --> 00:43:23,491
Cable chick.

625
00:43:35,044 --> 00:43:36,128
Becky.

626
00:43:36,212 --> 00:43:37,797
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,798
the other one.

628
00:43:38,881 --> 00:43:40,132
And it's such a mystery

629
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,009
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,637
So, all we need is a...

631
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,972
service truck like that one,

632
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:48,015
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,434
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:43:50,518 --> 00:43:51,978
I have my doubts.

635
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,188
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:43:55,356 --> 00:43:58,150
You think he's...

637
00:43:58,234 --> 00:44:00,653
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:44:00,736 --> 00:44:02,947
He should know better.

639
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,657
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:09,078
Right. Where you going?

641
00:44:09,203 --> 00:44:11,455
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:22,216
Are you kidding me?

643
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:28,389
How does he do that?

644
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:29,432
How do you do that?

645
00:44:29,515 --> 00:44:30,725
What are you saying?

646
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,226
Hey, how are you?

647
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,728
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:36,606
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,024
And you are...?

650
00:44:38,107 --> 00:44:39,442
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:40,901
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:44:40,943 --> 00:44:43,946
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,531
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:47,783
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,368
If it's on the menu.

656
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:50,953
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:52,830
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:54,790
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:44:54,874 --> 00:44:55,791
No.

660
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,084
Perfect.

661
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:44,942
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:46,277
The cable's out.

663
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,778
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:46:47,862 --> 00:46:50,114
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:57,705
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:46:57,788 --> 00:47:00,207
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:01,876
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

668
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:03,544
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:05,630
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

670
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:06,797
if that would be good.

671
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:08,382
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:11,093
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:14,513
What time's the appointment?

674
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:16,515
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

675
00:47:25,816 --> 00:47:26,734
Hello?

676
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:28,194
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:47:28,277 --> 00:47:29,570
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:31,364
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:32,365
Yes.

680
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:33,699
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:35,326
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:36,327
earlier than expected.

683
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,912
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:47:37,995 --> 00:47:39,246
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,749
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:42,792
Have a nice day.

687
00:47:44,168 --> 00:47:45,920
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:47:46,003 --> 00:47:48,923
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:47:49,006 --> 00:47:51,467
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:47:53,803 --> 00:47:57,598
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:01,018
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:48:01,102 --> 00:48:02,520
or the image will streak.

693
00:48:02,603 --> 00:48:03,521
- Ow.
- Ooh.

694
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:05,064
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

695
00:48:06,357 --> 00:48:07,858
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:09,402
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:48:09,485 --> 00:48:10,403
But you had a prom date?

698
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:12,613
It was his cousin.

699
00:48:12,655 --> 00:48:14,198
There's cable lines

700
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:16,075
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:48:16,158 --> 00:48:17,952
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:48:18,035 --> 00:48:20,454
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:48:22,498 --> 00:48:23,541
Okay.

704
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:25,251
Just want you to know

705
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:26,460
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:48:26,544 --> 00:48:27,461
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,297
I second that.

708
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,050
It's going to be fine.

709
00:48:34,343 --> 00:48:35,928
What?

710
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:37,972
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:48:38,055 --> 00:48:39,056
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,226
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:48,232
You'll be great.

714
00:48:48,316 --> 00:48:49,442
Yeah.

715
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:02,371
Morning.

716
00:49:02,455 --> 00:49:03,664
Can I see some I.D.?

717
00:49:13,174 --> 00:49:15,343
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:49:15,426 --> 00:49:16,886
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:49:16,969 --> 00:49:18,471
All right.

720
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:51,712
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:55,508
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:00,972
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:50:01,055 --> 00:50:03,766
Hey! Hey!

724
00:50:09,647 --> 00:50:10,690
Relax,

725
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:12,900
Jesus Christ.

726
00:50:12,984 --> 00:50:15,236
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,406
Come on.

728
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:21,617
House.

729
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:23,661
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:29,792
It's okay,

731
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:32,545
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:37,216
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:40,261
Becky.

734
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:45,266
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:46,976
Yeah, of course.

736
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:48,269
This way.

737
00:50:49,353 --> 00:50:51,147
You have a really nice house.

738
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,482
Yeah. 1922.

739
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:56,152
All the original tiles.

740
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:57,820
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:50:57,903 --> 00:51:00,615
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:51:00,698 --> 00:51:02,116
What a tactic.

743
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:03,451
Monastery?

744
00:51:03,534 --> 00:51:05,870
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:08,539
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:10,958
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,628
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:15,963
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:18,299
What does do it for you?

750
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:21,636
Um... TVs?

751
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:23,429
I have a monster TV.

752
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:25,681
Not working right now, but...

753
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:27,475
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:29,101
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:51:29,226 --> 00:51:30,645
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:51:30,686 --> 00:51:32,146
Over here.

757
00:51:34,231 --> 00:51:37,652
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,153
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:42,823
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:46,577
Here we go.

761
00:51:46,661 --> 00:51:47,620
There's our baby.

762
00:51:48,663 --> 00:51:50,122
We got him.

763
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:52,041
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:51:52,124 --> 00:51:53,668
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:57,964
Just right here?

766
00:51:58,047 --> 00:51:59,006
Yeah.

767
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:00,841
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:02,760
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:52:02,843 --> 00:52:04,762
That's my stereo.

770
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,305
I bet most of your customers

771
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,641
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:52:08,724 --> 00:52:10,268
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:11,519
Oh, yeah.

774
00:52:11,602 --> 00:52:13,479
He's hitting on her.

775
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:14,647
There's no problem here.

776
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,357
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:19,694
Okay.

778
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,948
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:52:24,031 --> 00:52:24,949
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:52:25,032 --> 00:52:26,450
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:28,494
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,917
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,794
Only the best.

784
00:52:36,877 --> 00:52:38,838
Check the box.

785
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,346
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,309
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:53,019
That should do it.

788
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:53,102
|

789
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,979
It's fixed?

790
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,481
Turn her on, let's see.

791
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:58,649
Now.

792
00:53:01,152 --> 00:53:02,695
Japan's Nikkei index...

793
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,238
Perfect.

794
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:06,574
...was the ending price

795
00:53:06,657 --> 00:53:08,409
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

796
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:10,911
Becky, huh?

797
00:53:10,995 --> 00:53:13,914
Have we met before?

798
00:53:13,956 --> 00:53:16,083
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

799
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,918
No, I don't think so.

800
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:19,420
If you can just sign there.

801
00:53:20,838 --> 00:53:22,840
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

802
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:24,592
would I be the first
one of your customers

803
00:53:24,634 --> 00:53:25,760
to ever do that?

804
00:53:25,843 --> 00:53:28,888
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

805
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:30,932
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

806
00:53:31,015 --> 00:53:32,099
had a handlebar mustache.

807
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:33,267
You know, not really my type.

808
00:53:33,351 --> 00:53:35,853
I don't think it's a good idea.

809
00:53:35,937 --> 00:53:38,105
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

810
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:40,942
No, actually, it's just my rule.

811
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:42,735
I don't go out
with strange men.

812
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:45,738
I just met you five minutes ago.

813
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:48,240
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

814
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:50,117
till we get to know each other
well enough.

815
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,913
Have a nice day.

816
00:53:53,996 --> 00:53:55,915
Come on,

817
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:57,375
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

818
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:58,960
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

819
00:53:59,043 --> 00:54:00,086
I'll just... I'll meet you.

820
00:54:00,169 --> 00:54:02,630
Anywhere you want to go.

821
00:54:02,713 --> 00:54:06,634
Come on, break your rule once.

822
00:54:07,718 --> 00:54:09,470
It's just dinner.

823
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,978
Is that a yes?

824
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,615
Are you okay?

825
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,118
Yeah.

826
00:54:32,201 --> 00:54:34,328
He touched my hand.

827
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,166
He came on to me.

828
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:43,963
Hey, at least I...

829
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:46,632
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

830
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,470
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

831
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,306
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

832
00:54:53,347 --> 00:54:55,141
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

833
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:57,018
Yeah.

834
00:54:58,227 --> 00:55:00,730
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

835
00:55:00,813 --> 00:55:02,732
Hey, Lyle,

836
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:05,067
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

837
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:06,402
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

838
00:55:06,485 --> 00:55:08,904
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

839
00:55:08,988 --> 00:55:10,197
Lyle!

840
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,491
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

841
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:13,743
No.

842
00:55:13,826 --> 00:55:15,953
I'm not calling you The Napster.

843
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:17,246
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

844
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,247
Well, I am.

845
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:20,207
And him, Handsome Rob.

846
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,834
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

847
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:24,378
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

848
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,922
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

849
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:29,175
Why are you encouraging this?

850
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:31,010
It is a verifiable fact...

851
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:33,471
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

852
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:35,306
I am The Napster.

853
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,226
All right, all right.

854
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:40,478
What is the distance

855
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:43,397
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

856
00:55:45,149 --> 00:55:47,526
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

857
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,612
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

858
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:51,489
from the vault
to the getaway car?

859
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:54,116
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

860
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:00,831
Six feet.

861
00:56:18,432 --> 00:56:19,976
Okay, you've got your gold.

862
00:56:41,622 --> 00:56:42,790
Whoo!

863
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:21,996
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

864
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,373
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

865
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,375
with the custom work, too.

866
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:27,752
I know a man for the job.

867
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:30,796
So I modified the camera
to include the...

868
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,633
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

869
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,759
Who's that?

870
00:57:34,842 --> 00:57:36,719
Rob's mechanic friend.

871
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:42,642
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

872
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,393
Charlie, this is Wrench.

873
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:45,937
Hey, what's up, man?

874
00:57:45,978 --> 00:57:47,688
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

875
00:57:47,772 --> 00:57:49,231
We need some body work done.

876
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:53,694
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

877
00:57:53,778 --> 00:57:55,071
with enough suspension
and horsepower

878
00:57:55,112 --> 00:57:57,156
to outrun anything chasing us.

879
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:58,991
2,700 pounds of what?

880
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,285
Of whatever.

881
00:58:03,412 --> 00:58:05,456
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

882
00:58:05,539 --> 00:58:06,958
10,000.

883
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,628
All right.

884
00:58:21,138 --> 00:58:23,099
What comes around...

885
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:39,031
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

886
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,992
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

887
00:58:41,033 --> 00:58:42,576
Wrench.

888
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,538
Ham and cheese.

889
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:47,290
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

890
00:58:47,331 --> 00:58:49,458
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

891
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,629
What comes around

892
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:58,175
Just comes around

893
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:14,859
What comes around

894
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,196
What comes around...

895
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,172
You want all greens?

896
00:59:36,255 --> 00:59:37,590
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

897
00:59:38,674 --> 00:59:39,717
What have you got?

898
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,136
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

899
00:59:42,219 --> 00:59:44,305
and Control Operations Center.

900
00:59:44,388 --> 00:59:46,140
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

901
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:47,433
and specifically designed
algorithms

902
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:49,185
to predict traffic conditions,

903
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:50,895
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

904
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,897
all I did was come up
with my own

905
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,358
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

906
00:59:55,441 --> 00:59:57,151
and now we own the place.

907
00:59:57,234 --> 00:59:58,194
You want to do a dry run?

908
00:59:58,235 --> 00:59:59,946
I thought you'd never ask.

909
01:00:02,073 --> 01:00:03,032
See, red light?

910
01:00:03,074 --> 01:00:04,075
Green light.

911
01:00:09,664 --> 01:00:10,665
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

912
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:11,749
What's up with Grid 34?

913
01:00:11,832 --> 01:00:13,751
Let's check it out.

914
01:00:13,793 --> 01:00:15,211
Hey, hey.

915
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:17,088
Oh, oops, did I...?

916
01:00:17,171 --> 01:00:19,632
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

917
01:00:19,715 --> 01:00:21,592
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:27,348 --> 01:00:28,266
Lights are working fine.

919
01:00:28,349 --> 01:00:30,643
Just an accident.

920
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:32,937
That's good.

921
01:00:34,438 --> 01:00:36,148
What are those?

922
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,067
Unnecessary engine parts.

923
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:41,862
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

924
01:00:41,946 --> 01:00:44,782
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

925
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:45,950
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

926
01:00:46,117 --> 01:00:47,201
And never getting lost

927
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:48,744
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

928
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:50,496
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

929
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,498
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

930
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:53,791
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

931
01:00:53,874 --> 01:00:55,501
And never getting lost

932
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:57,211
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

933
01:00:57,295 --> 01:00:59,422
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

934
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:01,841
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

935
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:04,468
Won't stop driving
till it's over

936
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:10,641
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

937
01:01:10,725 --> 01:01:13,144
Won't stop driving
till it's over

938
01:01:13,227 --> 01:01:14,937
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

939
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:16,314
And never getting lost

940
01:01:16,397 --> 01:01:17,898
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

941
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:20,443
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

942
01:01:20,484 --> 01:01:23,279
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

943
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:29,952
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

944
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:32,330
The look on Steve's face.

945
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,216
You're early.

946
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,926
I'm in a hurry.

947
01:01:49,013 --> 01:01:50,056
Of course, you know
that the Florida

948
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,308
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

949
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:53,309
Is that so?

950
01:01:53,392 --> 01:01:54,644
Yeah, which is not
so very different

951
01:01:54,685 --> 01:01:55,895
from when your John F. Kennedy

952
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,648
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

953
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:00,274
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

954
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,860
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

955
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:04,779
You Americans.

956
01:02:04,862 --> 01:02:06,530
You love your heroes.

957
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:09,492
A holiday for Columbus?

958
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:11,410
He makes the wrong turn,

959
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,913
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

960
01:02:14,038 --> 01:02:15,206
And you know
what he was looking for?

961
01:02:15,289 --> 01:02:16,916
I bet you're going to tell me.

962
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,084
Gold.

963
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,919
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

964
01:02:20,044 --> 01:02:21,796
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

965
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:23,339
didn't want a part
of that action.

966
01:02:23,422 --> 01:02:25,675
And what did Italy
need gold for?

967
01:02:25,716 --> 01:02:30,054
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

968
01:02:30,137 --> 01:02:31,389
Venice...
that's where

969
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:33,391
these bricks...

970
01:02:38,646 --> 01:02:39,647
You were saying something?

971
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,232
Nothing... No...

972
01:02:41,315 --> 01:02:42,441
No, you were really
on a roll there.

973
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,859
Don't stop. I'm interested.

974
01:02:43,943 --> 01:02:45,861
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

975
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:49,156
You understand fine.

976
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:50,449
Now what do you know
about my gold?

977
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:51,450
No, I don't...

978
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,619
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

979
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:56,664
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

980
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:59,250
about a heist in Venice.

981
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:01,585
35 million in bricks,

982
01:03:01,669 --> 01:03:04,005
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

983
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,548
- Who have you told?
- No one.

984
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:06,549
Who have you told?

985
01:03:06,632 --> 01:03:08,592
No one!
I swear to God!

986
01:03:10,595 --> 01:03:11,721
You swear to God?

987
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:14,223
You crazy?
I swear to God.

988
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:15,266
I didn't!

989
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:18,060
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

990
01:03:48,007 --> 01:03:49,425
Yevhen?

991
01:03:51,636 --> 01:03:53,137
Yevhen?

992
01:04:10,154 --> 01:04:11,322
Let's putt it this time...

993
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,659
Putt, not drive.

994
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:16,035
Very good.

995
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:17,370
If you can just get it,

996
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,372
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

997
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,706
Much better.

998
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,792
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

999
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,126
Yeah, he's over there.

1000
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:25,753
Thanks, man.

1001
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:29,674
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

1002
01:04:29,757 --> 01:04:30,800
Don't stare.

1003
01:04:30,883 --> 01:04:32,218
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1004
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,260
Stare at what?

1005
01:04:34,595 --> 01:04:35,846
That was good.
That was good.

1006
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:37,515
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1007
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,935
That was great.

1008
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:42,687
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

1009
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:43,938
What's up, man?

1010
01:04:44,063 --> 01:04:45,314
How's it going?

1011
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:47,942
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1012
01:04:48,025 --> 01:04:49,902
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1013
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,238
some supplies.

1014
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,239
Baby, go relax.

1015
01:04:53,322 --> 01:04:54,240
Baby...

1016
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:55,658
Go relax.

1017
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,748
Yo.

1018
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,792
Yo.

1019
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,502
Supplies.

1020
01:05:06,544 --> 01:05:07,378
What's wrong?

1021
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:08,546
Huh?

1022
01:05:08,629 --> 01:05:11,257
Uh... um, some, uh,

1023
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,466
some nitromin,

1024
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:14,176
uh...

1025
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,678
some, uh...

1026
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:18,014
some nitromin, primer...

1027
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:19,432
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

1028
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:19,890
Yo.

1029
01:05:19,974 --> 01:05:21,058
Uh, nothing.

1030
01:05:21,142 --> 01:05:22,059
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1031
01:05:22,143 --> 01:05:23,769
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1032
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,771
Nitromin, primer,

1033
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,106
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

1034
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,233
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1035
01:05:29,317 --> 01:05:32,069
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1036
01:05:32,153 --> 01:05:33,863
All right.

1037
01:05:39,744 --> 01:05:41,454
Cost you about five G's.

1038
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:43,497
Done. Call me.

1039
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:46,208
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1040
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:48,085
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1041
01:05:48,169 --> 01:05:49,962
- Peace.
- Come on.

1042
01:06:07,605 --> 01:06:09,398
Get out.

1043
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:11,233
There.

1044
01:06:20,493 --> 01:06:22,244
Vance has something
to tell you.

1045
01:06:25,623 --> 01:06:26,749
Go on.

1046
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,128
A couple weeks back...

1047
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:35,383
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1048
01:06:35,466 --> 01:06:38,135
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1049
01:06:38,219 --> 01:06:40,012
dancer on them.

1050
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,514
What did you tell him?

1051
01:06:43,391 --> 01:06:45,601
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1052
01:06:50,648 --> 01:06:52,692
I'm sorry.

1053
01:06:53,985 --> 01:06:56,487
What did this man look like?

1054
01:06:57,738 --> 01:06:58,698
He had, uh...

1055
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,116
long black hair,

1056
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:02,201
big tattoo on his neck.

1057
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,790
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1058
01:07:07,873 --> 01:07:09,166
I know that guy.

1059
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:39,322
Baby, go relax.

1060
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,043
Do you know who I am?

1061
01:07:53,127 --> 01:07:54,587
You're Mashkov.

1062
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,547
That's right.

1063
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:59,258
You were asking
about gold bricks

1064
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,010
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1065
01:08:02,053 --> 01:08:03,512
Tell me why.

1066
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,188
Steve just called to confirm

1067
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:14,231
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1068
01:08:14,273 --> 01:08:15,650
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1069
01:08:15,733 --> 01:08:18,486
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

1070
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:20,529
Safe popped by 8:25.

1071
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:22,990
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1072
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:24,575
Straight to Union Station.

1073
01:08:24,659 --> 01:08:25,993
Only green lights on your route.

1074
01:08:26,077 --> 01:08:27,203
The rest of the city's red.

1075
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:28,871
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1076
01:08:28,996 --> 01:08:29,997
Train leaves at 10:00.

1077
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:32,291
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

1078
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:34,335
Timing's got to be dead on.

1079
01:08:34,418 --> 01:08:35,711
Let's get ready.

1080
01:08:35,753 --> 01:08:37,213
Let's get it.

1081
01:09:08,202 --> 01:09:10,871
Wow, that is a nice car.

1082
01:09:10,997 --> 01:09:12,665
Sorry, Rob.

1083
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:13,916
Coast is clear, guys.

1084
01:09:25,803 --> 01:09:26,762
This is it, guys.

1085
01:09:26,804 --> 01:09:27,805
Moment of truth.

1086
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:30,600
What the hell is this?

1087
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:34,770
Shit!

1088
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,856
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1089
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,861
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1090
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,738
No.

1091
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,159
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1092
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:49,910
Too many witnesses.

1093
01:09:49,994 --> 01:09:51,037
Stella.

1094
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,789
I know, I know.

1095
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,460
I'm late for my date.

1096
01:09:57,543 --> 01:10:00,212
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1097
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:01,922
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1098
01:10:02,006 --> 01:10:03,299
Sorry.

1099
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:05,968
Let's get out of the street.

1100
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:11,849
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1101
01:10:11,933 --> 01:10:13,643
What's that supposed to mean?

1102
01:10:13,684 --> 01:10:15,269
Well, you don't really seem

1103
01:10:15,353 --> 01:10:19,106
like the adventurous type,
you know?

1104
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,485
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1105
01:10:22,526 --> 01:10:25,655
I wasn't making assumptions.

1106
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:27,156
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1107
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:29,909
Oh, really?

1108
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,035
And?

1109
01:10:34,288 --> 01:10:36,290
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1110
01:10:42,254 --> 01:10:44,465
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1111
01:10:44,548 --> 01:10:45,716
Let's go back to my place.

1112
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,759
No assumptions...

1113
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,344
Not tonight.
It's late.

1114
01:10:48,427 --> 01:10:49,387
I should go home.

1115
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,473
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1116
01:10:52,556 --> 01:10:53,557
No,

1117
01:10:53,599 --> 01:10:56,978
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1118
01:10:57,061 --> 01:10:58,229
Hey.

1119
01:10:58,312 --> 01:11:00,523
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1120
01:11:00,564 --> 01:11:03,317
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

1121
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:04,402
you still don't trust me?

1122
01:11:04,485 --> 01:11:08,239
Oh, I trust everyone.

1123
01:11:08,322 --> 01:11:11,617
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1124
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,873
It's an interesting saying.

1125
01:11:17,915 --> 01:11:19,292
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1126
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:21,752
Can't remember.

1127
01:11:21,836 --> 01:11:23,337
Really?

1128
01:11:23,421 --> 01:11:25,589
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1129
01:11:25,673 --> 01:11:26,757
Really?

1130
01:11:26,841 --> 01:11:29,218
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1131
01:11:29,302 --> 01:11:31,304
He said it all the time.

1132
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,513
His name was John Bridger.

1133
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,225
You're hurting my wrist.

1134
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:38,644
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1135
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:44,817
Let go of my wrist.

1136
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,819
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1137
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:50,072
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1138
01:11:50,114 --> 01:11:52,783
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1139
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:54,744
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1140
01:11:57,455 --> 01:11:59,665
Who are you working with?

1141
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,088
She's with us.

1142
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,101
Gang's all here.

1143
01:12:19,143 --> 01:12:21,938
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1144
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:23,564
A coward.

1145
01:12:23,648 --> 01:12:24,649
Then you should have seen

1146
01:12:24,732 --> 01:12:26,400
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1147
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:31,030
It's not worth it.

1148
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,198
Put a leash on your cat.

1149
01:12:37,828 --> 01:12:38,788
Hi, Steve.

1150
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:40,122
Charlie.

1151
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,793
Not bad, Charlie.

1152
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:44,835
Really, not bad.

1153
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:47,046
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1154
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,839
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1155
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:50,299
with my bare hands.

1156
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,801
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1157
01:12:51,884 --> 01:12:54,387
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1158
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,554
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

1159
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:57,306
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1160
01:12:57,348 --> 01:12:59,100
That wasn't about emotion.

1161
01:12:59,183 --> 01:13:01,394
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1162
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:03,312
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1163
01:13:03,396 --> 01:13:05,898
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1164
01:13:06,023 --> 01:13:07,566
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1165
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,110
Okay?

1166
01:13:09,193 --> 01:13:11,821
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1167
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:14,365
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1168
01:13:14,448 --> 01:13:16,158
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1169
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:17,994
that's fine with me.

1170
01:13:18,077 --> 01:13:22,331
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1171
01:13:22,373 --> 01:13:24,292
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1172
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,295
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1173
01:13:27,378 --> 01:13:30,298
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1174
01:13:30,381 --> 01:13:32,675
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1175
01:13:32,717 --> 01:13:34,010
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1176
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:36,929
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1177
01:13:37,054 --> 01:13:38,848
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1178
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:40,891
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1179
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:44,312
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1180
01:13:44,395 --> 01:13:45,938
but I just don't see it.

1181
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:47,356
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1182
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,108
Same old Steve, huh?

1183
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,527
Always thinking defensively.

1184
01:13:51,569 --> 01:13:53,279
That's why you're
always number two.

1185
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,406
How do you figure that?

1186
01:13:55,489 --> 01:13:56,949
You got no imagination.

1187
01:13:57,033 --> 01:13:59,368
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1188
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,454
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1189
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,873
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1190
01:14:03,956 --> 01:14:05,041
That gold is already gone.

1191
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:06,792
That's bullshit, Steve.

1192
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,794
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1193
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:10,796
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1194
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,466
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1195
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,593
I mean, really, be my guest.

1196
01:14:15,676 --> 01:14:17,386
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1197
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,596
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1198
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:19,597
you had going for you.

1199
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,724
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1200
01:14:25,686 --> 01:14:26,979
Surprised?

1201
01:14:30,358 --> 01:14:31,400
It's over when I say it's over.

1202
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,406
Are you all right, sir?

1203
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:10,356
How you doing?

1204
01:15:12,566 --> 01:15:15,319
Good...

1205
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:18,114
considering...

1206
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:20,574
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1207
01:15:20,658 --> 01:15:21,909
for a man I barely knew.

1208
01:15:29,166 --> 01:15:34,255
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1209
01:15:34,338 --> 01:15:37,758
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1210
01:15:37,842 --> 01:15:39,802
that he was on some job,

1211
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:43,431
I knew you were right there
with him.

1212
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:49,270
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1213
01:15:51,355 --> 01:15:53,149
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1214
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:54,859
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1215
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:57,320
Be nice if it was true.

1216
01:15:57,361 --> 01:15:58,654
It is true.

1217
01:15:58,696 --> 01:16:00,615
He always regretted
not having been

1218
01:16:00,698 --> 01:16:02,658
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1219
01:16:05,536 --> 01:16:06,996
How do you know that?

1220
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:09,457
Because he told me.

1221
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,340
What did you do to your hand?

1222
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:22,678
I punched Steve.

1223
01:16:22,762 --> 01:16:26,015
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1224
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:30,478
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1225
01:16:38,444 --> 01:16:39,820
Hey.

1226
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:47,286
Okay?

1227
01:16:56,003 --> 01:16:57,630
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1228
01:17:04,136 --> 01:17:07,139
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1229
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:08,391
Charlie!

1230
01:17:11,102 --> 01:17:12,144
He's flying the coop.

1231
01:17:13,437 --> 01:17:14,605
When?

1232
01:17:14,689 --> 01:17:16,148
His security guard called

1233
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:18,401
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

1234
01:17:18,442 --> 01:17:21,070
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

1235
01:17:21,112 --> 01:17:24,907
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1236
01:17:24,949 --> 01:17:25,908
to Mexico City.

1237
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:29,412
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1238
01:17:29,453 --> 01:17:31,163
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1239
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,291
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1240
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:34,500
It's going to be in that truck

1241
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,793
and he's going to be watching it

1242
01:17:35,876 --> 01:17:37,586
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1243
01:17:37,628 --> 01:17:39,380
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1244
01:17:39,463 --> 01:17:40,423
Who knows where?

1245
01:17:40,464 --> 01:17:41,549
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1246
01:17:41,632 --> 01:17:42,591
Slow down, slow down.

1247
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:43,509
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1248
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:44,593
This is good news for us.

1249
01:17:44,677 --> 01:17:46,929
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1250
01:17:47,013 --> 01:17:48,806
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1251
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:50,099
now the safe is coming to us.

1252
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:51,475
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1253
01:17:51,559 --> 01:17:52,476
Charlie, it could take

1254
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,686
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1255
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,438
We have no idea which one.

1256
01:17:55,521 --> 01:17:57,773
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1257
01:17:57,815 --> 01:17:58,816
We're already set up to do it.

1258
01:17:58,858 --> 01:18:00,276
Napster,

1259
01:18:00,318 --> 01:18:04,363
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1260
01:18:04,447 --> 01:18:06,616
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1261
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:07,867
Where do we want it to go?

1262
01:18:07,992 --> 01:18:10,494
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1263
01:18:10,578 --> 01:18:12,955
We do it like the Italian job.

1264
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,171
Hello?

1265
01:18:20,254 --> 01:18:21,505
Why'd you do it?

1266
01:18:21,589 --> 01:18:22,423
Do what?

1267
01:18:22,506 --> 01:18:23,215
Yevhen.

1268
01:18:23,299 --> 01:18:24,967
You didn't have to clip him.

1269
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:26,010
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1270
01:18:26,093 --> 01:18:27,011
We didn't clip anybody.

1271
01:18:27,094 --> 01:18:28,095
Yevhen's cousin is under

1272
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:30,848
the distinct impression
that you did.

1273
01:18:30,932 --> 01:18:31,974
Why does he think that?

1274
01:18:32,058 --> 01:18:33,225
Because you want to know

1275
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:35,227
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1276
01:18:35,311 --> 01:18:36,562
You told him that?

1277
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:37,897
Listen to me, man.

1278
01:18:38,022 --> 01:18:39,815
If there's one thing that I know

1279
01:18:39,857 --> 01:18:41,859
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1280
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,445
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1281
01:18:44,528 --> 01:18:48,115
Look, I need a favor.

1282
01:19:14,141 --> 01:19:15,184
Yeah.

1283
01:19:15,268 --> 01:19:16,352
Had a hiccup last night.

1284
01:19:16,435 --> 01:19:17,353
Could use some help.

1285
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:18,521
Want hands-on this time.

1286
01:19:18,604 --> 01:19:19,855
You interested?

1287
01:19:19,939 --> 01:19:20,856
Could be.

1288
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:23,192
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1289
01:19:23,234 --> 01:19:25,611
If I'm in, I'm in.

1290
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,863
Okay, you're in.

1291
01:19:27,905 --> 01:19:29,156
All right.

1292
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:33,369
What do you think, Charlie?

1293
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:34,412
This'll work.

1294
01:19:34,495 --> 01:19:35,955
Let's go.

1295
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:48,217
You're amazing.

1296
01:19:48,301 --> 01:19:49,719
It's a work of genius.

1297
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:50,720
Uh-huh.

1298
01:19:59,478 --> 01:20:01,439
You okay?

1299
01:20:01,522 --> 01:20:02,440
Just give me a moment.

1300
01:20:02,523 --> 01:20:03,649
Now?

1301
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:06,902
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1302
01:20:06,944 --> 01:20:08,904
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1303
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:11,532
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1304
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,245
Take all the time you need.

1305
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,875
Hey, Charlie.

1306
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:23,919
What?

1307
01:20:24,045 --> 01:20:27,423
I love you, man.

1308
01:20:27,465 --> 01:20:29,759
I love you, too.

1309
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:35,431
Okay.
Okay.

1310
01:20:45,816 --> 01:20:47,610
Your attention, please.

1311
01:20:47,652 --> 01:20:49,487
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1312
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:51,322
in approximately 15 minutes.

1313
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:09,840
Check positions.

1314
01:21:09,924 --> 01:21:10,925
Napster?

1315
01:21:11,008 --> 01:21:13,844
I'm in position.

1316
01:21:13,928 --> 01:21:15,429
Handsome Rob?

1317
01:21:15,513 --> 01:21:16,722
We're in position.

1318
01:21:16,806 --> 01:21:18,808
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1319
01:21:21,894 --> 01:21:23,896
Wrench?

1320
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,648
Set.

1321
01:21:41,872 --> 01:21:43,541
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1322
01:21:43,624 --> 01:21:46,294
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1323
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:47,336
We'll deal with it.

1324
01:21:53,718 --> 01:21:55,428
Who are these cats?

1325
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:56,554
What's wrong?

1326
01:21:56,637 --> 01:21:58,598
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1327
01:21:58,681 --> 01:22:00,725
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1328
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:04,353
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1329
01:22:04,437 --> 01:22:06,188
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1330
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,065
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1331
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:09,900
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1332
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:13,279
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1333
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:15,406
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1334
01:22:26,751 --> 01:22:28,419
Okay, let's go!

1335
01:22:28,502 --> 01:22:30,504
Moving out!

1336
01:22:43,142 --> 01:22:44,727
Here we go.

1337
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:46,437
They're pulling out.

1338
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,147
Napster,

1339
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:51,108
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1340
01:22:51,192 --> 01:22:53,903
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1341
01:22:56,948 --> 01:22:59,659
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1342
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:01,911
See which one's riding low.

1343
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,298
First one is...

1344
01:23:16,801 --> 01:23:18,511
First two are the same, so...

1345
01:23:22,723 --> 01:23:25,601
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1346
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:36,487
We're moving out.

1347
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:39,865
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1348
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:41,158
we're heading to the airport.

1349
01:23:55,756 --> 01:23:59,719
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1350
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:01,470
Gridlock time.

1351
01:24:03,055 --> 01:24:06,684
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1352
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:08,644
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1353
01:24:10,646 --> 01:24:12,565
We've crashed.

1354
01:24:14,358 --> 01:24:16,319
It's not a crash.

1355
01:24:17,486 --> 01:24:18,863
We've got power.

1356
01:24:19,947 --> 01:24:21,741
I can't log in.

1357
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:26,203
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1358
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:34,086
Oops.

1359
01:24:38,591 --> 01:24:41,844
You'll... never... shut down...

1360
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:44,680
the real... Napster.

1361
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:53,773
What's your problem?!

1362
01:25:00,112 --> 01:25:02,031
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

1363
01:25:02,073 --> 01:25:03,866
This is truck 128.

1364
01:25:03,908 --> 01:25:05,701
Traffic's out of control here.

1365
01:25:05,743 --> 01:25:07,703
We've got to look
for another route.

1366
01:25:07,745 --> 01:25:11,123
Check the police band.

1367
01:25:11,207 --> 01:25:13,125
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1368
01:25:17,463 --> 01:25:18,881
Oh, get us out of here.

1369
01:25:18,923 --> 01:25:20,007
I'm trying.

1370
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:27,056
And he's taking it.

1371
01:25:32,687 --> 01:25:34,397
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1372
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:35,481
at Traffic Control Center.

1373
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:38,609
Nice, Charlie.

1374
01:25:38,693 --> 01:25:40,903
What are you up to?

1375
01:25:40,987 --> 01:25:43,239
Go back.

1376
01:25:51,372 --> 01:25:53,666
I now command you to turn left.

1377
01:25:55,626 --> 01:25:57,128
Come on, take the left.

1378
01:25:59,297 --> 01:26:00,631
Yeah, you did.

1379
01:26:00,715 --> 01:26:02,258
You did.

1380
01:26:36,834 --> 01:26:38,127
Give us the flag.

1381
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,212
Metro just passed through
the station.

1382
01:26:40,296 --> 01:26:42,298
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1383
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:43,507
Go.

1384
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:00,358
Come on, Steve.

1385
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:18,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1386
01:27:22,505 --> 01:27:25,174
Look out!
Look out!

1387
01:27:25,257 --> 01:27:26,217
30 seconds and counting.

1388
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:35,142
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1389
01:27:35,226 --> 01:27:36,352
or you're paint on the train.

1390
01:27:42,316 --> 01:27:43,276
Go, go, come on, come on!

1391
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:46,070
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1392
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:54,537
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1393
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,539
You're gonna stop right there.

1394
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:36,412
Okay, guys.

1395
01:28:36,495 --> 01:28:37,913
Coming into position.

1396
01:28:37,997 --> 01:28:39,290
Stay cool.

1397
01:28:51,344 --> 01:28:52,678
Ten...

1398
01:28:52,762 --> 01:28:54,805
nine...

1399
01:28:54,889 --> 01:28:56,599
eight...

1400
01:28:56,682 --> 01:28:58,434
seven...

1401
01:28:58,476 --> 01:28:59,810
six...

1402
01:28:59,894 --> 01:29:01,520
five...

1403
01:29:01,604 --> 01:29:03,272
four...

1404
01:29:03,356 --> 01:29:04,106
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1405
01:29:04,190 --> 01:29:05,608
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

1406
01:29:05,691 --> 01:29:07,610
two...

1407
01:29:07,693 --> 01:29:09,362
one.

1408
01:29:30,967 --> 01:29:32,551
Damn.

1409
01:29:38,808 --> 01:29:40,351
Where's my truck?

1410
01:29:40,434 --> 01:29:42,937
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1411
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,318
It just blew right through
the street.

1412
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,820
Well, get under there.

1413
01:30:01,539 --> 01:30:04,250
We have another problem, guys.

1414
01:30:04,333 --> 01:30:05,126
What?

1415
01:30:06,252 --> 01:30:08,087
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

1416
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,005
What?

1417
01:30:10,339 --> 01:30:11,924
He switched safes on us.

1418
01:30:13,384 --> 01:30:14,593
Can you do it?

1419
01:30:14,677 --> 01:30:16,012
It's Israeli made.

1420
01:30:16,095 --> 01:30:17,722
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1421
01:30:17,805 --> 01:30:19,932
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1422
01:30:20,016 --> 01:30:21,726
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1423
01:30:21,809 --> 01:30:23,686
steel rods snap into place

1424
01:30:23,728 --> 01:30:24,895
and you can't open the safe.

1425
01:30:24,979 --> 01:30:26,689
And then we're up shit creek.

1426
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:59,513
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1427
01:31:00,723 --> 01:31:02,600
I don't think it broke though.

1428
01:31:02,683 --> 01:31:05,478
I can't drill it again.

1429
01:31:05,561 --> 01:31:08,064
I have to do it by touch.

1430
01:31:10,483 --> 01:31:11,651
I can't get through.

1431
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:13,235
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1432
01:31:13,319 --> 01:31:15,196
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1433
01:31:15,237 --> 01:31:16,238
11th and Fig.

1434
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,907
Positions two and three,

1435
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:19,784
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

1436
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:20,910
to Hollywood and Highland.

1437
01:31:20,993 --> 01:31:22,578
Hurry up!

1438
01:31:37,301 --> 01:31:39,262
Your attention please.

1439
01:31:39,345 --> 01:31:41,347
Baggage for train number 22

1440
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,641
is now available
at carousel number four.

1441
01:31:43,724 --> 01:31:46,602
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1442
01:31:46,686 --> 01:31:48,437
at carousel number four.

1443
01:32:21,846 --> 01:32:23,806
I can't do this, Charlie.

1444
01:32:23,848 --> 01:32:24,807
Stella...

1445
01:32:24,849 --> 01:32:25,933
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

1446
01:32:26,058 --> 01:32:27,226
a borescope, something.

1447
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:28,644
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

1448
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:30,062
Come on, Charlie.

1449
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:32,315
Hey, you can do this.

1450
01:33:27,411 --> 01:33:28,621
Slide.

1451
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,997
Come on, come on.

1452
01:33:36,545 --> 01:33:38,047
Hey.

1453
01:33:38,130 --> 01:33:41,300
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1454
01:33:41,384 --> 01:33:42,468
Absolutely.

1455
01:33:45,763 --> 01:33:47,265
Napster.

1456
01:33:47,348 --> 01:33:48,266
Yeah?

1457
01:33:48,349 --> 01:33:50,351
13 across, four high, four deep.

1458
01:33:52,019 --> 01:33:54,438
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1459
01:33:54,522 --> 01:33:55,690
How much?

1460
01:33:55,731 --> 01:33:58,109
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1461
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:03,072
2.7... 2.7 million.

1462
01:34:03,114 --> 01:34:03,864
What?

1463
01:34:04,907 --> 01:34:06,033
No, it's 27.

1464
01:34:06,117 --> 01:34:07,493
That's 27 million.

1465
01:34:07,576 --> 01:34:09,495
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1466
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:16,877
Yeah!

1467
01:34:16,919 --> 01:34:20,840
Got the... holy spirit.

1468
01:34:20,923 --> 01:34:23,342
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1469
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:02,089
What did you think, John?

1470
01:35:10,222 --> 01:35:11,766
27 million.

1471
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:13,267
Say it again.

1472
01:35:13,309 --> 01:35:15,645
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

1473
01:35:15,686 --> 01:35:17,647
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

1474
01:35:17,688 --> 01:35:18,856
Say it again!

1475
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:44,090
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1476
01:35:47,426 --> 01:35:49,095
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1477
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:50,721
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1478
01:35:50,805 --> 01:35:52,390
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1479
01:35:57,395 --> 01:35:58,437
Shit!

1480
01:36:02,692 --> 01:36:03,317
Whoa!

1481
01:36:17,581 --> 01:36:18,457
Here we go.

1482
01:36:27,717 --> 01:36:28,342
Whoo!

1483
01:36:30,428 --> 01:36:30,970
Whoa! Whoa!

1484
01:36:33,723 --> 01:36:34,307
Open your door.

1485
01:36:39,645 --> 01:36:41,731
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1486
01:36:46,944 --> 01:36:48,404
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1487
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,708
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1488
01:37:27,985 --> 01:37:29,612
Come on!

1489
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,621
Where you going?
Where you going?

1490
01:37:58,057 --> 01:37:58,933
I'm going to take Steve.

1491
01:37:58,975 --> 01:38:00,101
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1492
01:38:00,142 --> 01:38:01,352
I'll meet you there.

1493
01:38:02,603 --> 01:38:04,146
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1494
01:38:12,613 --> 01:38:14,699
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1495
01:38:18,202 --> 01:38:19,870
I know it's you, Charlie.

1496
01:38:21,872 --> 01:38:22,873
Take your next left.

1497
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,893
Nice move, Steve.

1498
01:40:02,306 --> 01:40:03,391
Get out!

1499
01:40:03,432 --> 01:40:05,268
- Get out!
- Okay.

1500
01:40:05,351 --> 01:40:06,894
I said get out!

1501
01:41:41,697 --> 01:41:42,657
They got a bunch of cars

1502
01:41:42,698 --> 01:41:44,325
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1503
01:41:44,367 --> 01:41:46,369
Look, look, man...

1504
01:41:46,452 --> 01:41:48,871
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

1505
01:41:48,913 --> 01:41:51,332
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1506
01:41:55,836 --> 01:41:58,214
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1507
01:42:02,843 --> 01:42:04,512
Come on.

1508
01:42:10,268 --> 01:42:12,353
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1509
01:42:17,275 --> 01:42:19,402
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1510
01:42:19,485 --> 01:42:22,738
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1511
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,408
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1512
01:42:25,491 --> 01:42:26,701
The helicopter routine,

1513
01:42:26,742 --> 01:42:28,536
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1514
01:42:28,577 --> 01:42:32,206
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

1515
01:42:32,248 --> 01:42:33,040
I got this.

1516
01:42:33,082 --> 01:42:34,292
So cut the crap,

1517
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:36,085
and give me my goddamn gold!

1518
01:42:50,141 --> 01:42:52,101
Who the hell are you?

1519
01:42:52,143 --> 01:42:53,936
I am Mashkov...

1520
01:42:54,061 --> 01:42:55,938
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1521
01:42:56,063 --> 01:42:57,982
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1522
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:09,118
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1523
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:11,245
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1524
01:43:11,287 --> 01:43:12,455
a lot of unsavory people.

1525
01:43:12,538 --> 01:43:14,206
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1526
01:43:14,290 --> 01:43:16,250
You are right...

1527
01:43:16,334 --> 01:43:18,294
no imagination.

1528
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,632
There's a lot of gold in there.

1529
01:43:22,715 --> 01:43:24,258
We're the only ones with guns.

1530
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,718
I'll make you a good deal.

1531
01:43:33,809 --> 01:43:35,645
I've already made my deal.

1532
01:43:40,983 --> 01:43:42,318
What do you want?

1533
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:44,654
You know this was
never about the gold.

1534
01:43:44,737 --> 01:43:46,906
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1535
01:43:51,327 --> 01:43:52,954
Bitch!

1536
01:43:53,037 --> 01:43:54,747
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1537
01:43:56,332 --> 01:43:57,458
Okay.

1538
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,171
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1539
01:44:02,254 --> 01:44:03,839
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1540
01:44:03,923 --> 01:44:04,840
Just don't shoot me.

1541
01:44:04,924 --> 01:44:07,093
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1542
01:44:07,176 --> 01:44:10,137
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1543
01:44:10,221 --> 01:44:12,056
I think you would be
very interested

1544
01:44:12,139 --> 01:44:13,724
in some of the machinery I use.

1545
01:44:16,644 --> 01:44:17,603
No, come on.

1546
01:44:23,192 --> 01:44:24,235
Guys.

1547
01:44:24,318 --> 01:44:26,445
I want to make a toast.

1548
01:44:26,529 --> 01:44:27,905
To John Bridger,

1549
01:44:27,989 --> 01:44:30,658
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1550
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:32,660
Father and friend.

1551
01:44:32,702 --> 01:44:33,744
To my dad.

1552
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:39,917
Stella was right.

1553
01:44:40,001 --> 01:44:41,460
It wasn't about the money.

1554
01:44:41,544 --> 01:44:43,004
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1555
01:44:43,087 --> 01:44:44,422
from having a little bit of fun.

1556
01:44:44,505 --> 01:44:46,424
Money!

1557
01:44:46,507 --> 01:44:48,926
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1558
01:44:50,553 --> 01:44:53,472
Get a good job with good pay...

1559
01:44:53,556 --> 01:44:55,766
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1560
01:44:58,019 --> 01:45:04,400
Money, it's a gas

1561
01:45:04,442 --> 01:45:09,655
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

1562
01:45:09,739 --> 01:45:11,198
He got off with a warning.

1563
01:45:11,282 --> 01:45:14,869
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

1564
01:45:14,952 --> 01:45:17,538
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1565
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,583
with a room just for his shoes.

1566
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:21,709
Buenos dias.

1567
01:45:21,751 --> 01:45:24,879
Buenos dias.

1568
01:45:24,962 --> 01:45:29,091
Money, get back

1569
01:45:29,175 --> 01:45:31,594
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1570
01:45:31,636 --> 01:45:36,098
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

1571
01:45:36,182 --> 01:45:37,266
Are you really the Napster?

1572
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:38,726
Money!

1573
01:45:38,768 --> 01:45:39,894
Yes, I am.

1574
01:45:39,977 --> 01:45:41,938
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1575
01:45:42,063 --> 01:45:46,108
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1576
01:45:46,192 --> 01:45:47,318
With speakers so loud

1577
01:45:47,401 --> 01:45:49,612
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

1578
01:45:49,654 --> 01:45:53,115
I'm in the high-fidelity...

1579
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:54,325
If you would.

1580
01:45:54,408 --> 01:45:55,910
...first class traveling set

1581
01:45:55,993 --> 01:46:01,415
And I think I need a Lear jet

1582
01:46:10,132 --> 01:46:11,884
And me?

1583
01:46:11,968 --> 01:46:14,887
I took John Bridger's advice.

1584
01:46:14,971 --> 01:46:18,224
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1585
01:46:18,307 --> 01:46:19,892
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.

1586
01:47:23,497 --> 01:47:25,875
Money!

1587
01:47:25,958 --> 01:47:29,545
It's a crime

1588
01:47:29,629 --> 01:47:36,761
Share it fairly, but don't
take a slice of my pie

1589
01:47:36,844 --> 01:47:43,100
Money, so they say

1590
01:47:43,184 --> 01:47:50,232
Is the root of all evil today

1591
01:47:50,316 --> 01:47:55,112
But if you ask for a raise
it's no surprise

1592
01:47:55,196 --> 01:47:58,616
They're giving none away

1593
01:47:58,699 --> 01:48:00,701
Away... away...

1594
01:48:00,785 --> 01:48:01,744
Away...

1595
01:48:01,786 --> 01:48:05,206
Away... away...

1596
01:48:05,247 --> 01:48:06,207
Away...

1597
01:48:06,248 --> 01:48:08,542
Away... away...

1598
01:48:08,584 --> 01:48:09,543
Away...

1599
01:48:09,585 --> 01:48:11,545
Away... away...

1600
01:48:11,587 --> 01:48:12,546
Away...

1601
01:48:12,588 --> 01:48:14,548
Away... away...

1602
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:15,549
Away...

1603
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:17,551
Away... away...

1604
01:48:17,593 --> 01:48:18,552
Away...

1605
01:48:18,594 --> 01:48:20,554
Away... away...

1606
01:48:20,596 --> 01:48:21,555
Away...

1607
01:48:21,597 --> 01:48:23,557
Away... away...

1608
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:24,558
Away...

1609
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,560
